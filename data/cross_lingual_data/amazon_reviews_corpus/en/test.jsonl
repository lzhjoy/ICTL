{"language": "en", "output": "good", "input": "Review: Not worth returning not worth rebuying\n\nThis purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying. Rating:", "id": "en_0538855"}

No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas.

The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently. Rating:", "id": "en_0082893"}

Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support! Rating:", "id": "en_0184810"}

Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting.

It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times Rating:", "id": "en_0669243"}

The finger slots are great and feel like a smooth soft rubber. I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them. Rating:", "id": "en_0607120"}

It is actually pretty effective. I have not seen any ants for days now. It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.

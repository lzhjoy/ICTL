As China Daily reported in February, the number of obese people under the age of 18 in China has reached 120 million.\nJamie has worked for 10 years to try and fight this problem. Learning about food is important not just because of health problems but also because many people still don't have enough food today. And we know as the improvement of science sometimes we have to face genetically modified   food. Don't worry - we'll make you know more about all these topics in our special article!\nWe'll also tell you something interesting about food. For example, do you know what the largest food on the menu is all over the world? It's the roasted camel and it has been served for several hundred years, often stuffed   with chicken, lamb, egg, fish and rice!\nHopefully by the time you finish reading this edition , you'll pay more attention to the food that you eat. As Oliver says, food is something that can help us enjoy our life. It is important that we love it!", "label": "C"}

I took my problem to the editor-in-chief, and.he said to me:\"Don't worry; you're creative. \"\nI'm not sure where the editor-in-chief reached the conclusion that I was \"creative\". Maybe it was through the poems I wrote. Personally, I simply enjoy writing because it's fun. There's also the fact that I can't draw or do anything else creatively, I'm equally sure that there are people in the boat on the other side who can make things look excellent, but can't write a poem.\nAt this point you probably want to ask me what poetry and art have to do with engineering.  For one, it makes you a more rounded person, making you a better engineer. More importantly, as an engineer, you will be faced with many problems every day. There are some that can be solved by consulting a textbook, but more often than not, you will need that thing in your brain to put together things in a completely original combination to solve the problem at hand.\nThink of the wonderful things that creative engineers have done. Civil engineers have made the road more long-lasting so we don't have to close them for repairs as often. Coming up with a new innovation   is similar to writing a good poem. It's not some-thing you plan to do. The critical moment comes unexpectedly in the middle of nowhere. You don't think about what you're doing, you simply do. After some mad struggling you take a look at the end product and say to yourself, \"This is a masterpiece. \" This is perhaps the greatest personal satisfaction one can\nexperience.\nSo all you engineers out there get out and do something creative. I don't care if it's writing a poem or a computer program, just be natural and do something creative.", "label": "A"}

The less ambitious or less fortunate artists traveled around their own areas and created pictures of countryside society. Anyway, artists got trained and those simple creations improved a lot.\nAround 1930,folk art began to take on a new meaning and was considered as an expression of a small cultural class. Folk art is never the product of art movements, but comes out of craft traditions. This art is based not on measurements or calculations and rarely goes with the standards of realism. It goes straight to the bases of art which the folk artists feel naturally.\nThe period 1930~ 1960 was the time when folk artists began to receive recognition. They often began their art careers late in life and used art as an outlet  for their energy. Their materials were cheap and simple, their subjects were different, but their creativity flowed. Doing their own things became the norm , and was what made folk art so desirable.\nAlthough it is hard to define folk art, one thing is certain --- it touches us in a special way because the artists show us how he or she brought beauty into their everyday life.

So he began to study the children's responses in situations where no milk was provided.

These changes will take place in SAT college exam. The changes include the use of some words more commonly used in school and on the job instead of the words such as \"prevaricator\" and \"sagacious\".\nCollege Board officials said the change is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay. For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers.\nThey also said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently can ask for help: practicing with flashcards. They know flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping.\nThe essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument and it will also be up to colleges whether the essay will be required. Each exam will include a passage drawn from \"founding documents\": such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired. Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, thought to be most  needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion .\nJim Rawlins, the director of admissions at the University of Oregon, said the changes will potentially help the students but it will take a few years to know its influence, after the students go on to college. He said some colleges are still dealing with questions about the changes made in 2005, such as how to consider the essay portion. The criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier families do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes.\nThe SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other main standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. The ACT took over the SAT in total use in 2012, partly because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of those states' testing scheme .\nACT president Jon Erickson said when hearing of the SAT changes, his reaction was that they could've been talking about the ACT now. \"I didn't hear anything new and different, so I was a little left wanting, at least at the end of this first announcement,\" Erickson said .\nBob Schaeffer, education director at the National Center for Fair & Open Testing, or FairTest, said it is laudable  that the SAT will provide free test preparation, but it is unlikely to make a dent in the market for such preparation. He also said the new test is unlikely to be better than the current one. His organization has a database with institutions that don't require ACT or SAT scores to make admissions decisions.", "label": "D"}

Other companies may not buy one for everybody, but they'll have a bank of these desks where people can go for an hour a day and answer their emails or talk on the phone. Even some U.S. schools are beginning to experiment with such desks to keep children moving.\nMr. Katzmarzyk says studying this problem has inspired his team to make a few changes in their own lives. \"As a university professor, you know, it is a very sedentary occupation.

The book was published just in time for the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth on February 12, 1809.\nRosalyn Schanzer carefully gathered Darwin's thoughts and observations from his diaries, letters and books. Many of the words in the book are Darwin's own. She also traveled to the Galapagos Islands and South America. She researched some of the places Darwin had visited on his trip on the ship, the Beagle in the 1830s. She took thousands of pictures, which helped her create the book's beautiful and color1ful drawings. These pictures show young readers what led Darwin to form his great discovery: the evolution of species through natural selection.\n\"What Darwin Saw\" tells of the adventures of a young man who traveled around the world as a scientist. The voyage of the Beagle took Charles Darwin to South America, where he rode horses with cowboys and met Native Americans in Argentina. He reported the eruption of the Osorno Volcano and experienced an earthquake in Chile. Darwin's observations showed him that environments can change very quickly and a great deal over time.\nRosalyn Schanzer brings to life the clues that suggested to Darwin that living things evolve, or change, over time. She illustrates the unusual tortoises, birds and lizards that Darwin studied in the Galapagos Islands. She shows how Darwin came to understand that these island animals had differences, developed over time, that helped them survive.

For students with emotional problems, music can help soothe  sadness. Consider the child that arrives in class depressed and upset.

If such people aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone speak a word in favor of their hopes. If they are criticized, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join in criticizing their wrong doings.

I have seen the condition of the building becoming worse and worse since I moved here last year.\nFirst of all, the management of the building is really terrible. Sometimes, there is a bad smell when I walk on the road. I see much rubbish there. No cleaners clean the rubbish. Many roaches and rats run around the building.\nMy second problem is about the security  . I always see the guards reading newspapers or smoking when they are on duty. The security room is very dusty too. When I want to use the phone, they say, \"We can't help.\"\nI am therefore writing to demand your company's action to improve the situation. Thank you for your consideration.\nYours faithfully,\nChris Wong", "label": "A"}

Not those newspapers are a necessity. Even now some people get most of the news from the television or have the radio switched on in the background or in the car. Many buy a paper only on Saturday or Sunday. But for most people a newspaper has become a habit passed down from generation to generation.\nThe basic British character won't change, and one of the characteristics of the British is that we don't much like talking to each other when we get up. So what better way is there to keep yourself thinking in the morning than to wrap yourself in a newspaper?\nOver the past couple of centuries, human beings have developed a close relationship with the newspaper. It has become as natural as breathing or enjoying the sun. And it is not just the British who love newspapers. On suburban trains in Calcutta, for instance, just one person in the whole car will buy a newspaper and read aloud the best bits to his fellow passengers, much to everybody's enjoyment.\nThe nature of what is news may change. What essentially makes news is what affects our lives and the big political stories, the coverage of the wars, earthquakes and other disasters, will continue much the same. I think there will be more coverage of scientific research, though. It's already happening in areas that may directly affect our lives, like genetic engineering. In the future I think there will be more coverage of scientific explanations of why we feel as we do, whether it's love or depression. We develop a better understanding of how the brain operates and what our feelings really are.\nIt's quite possible that in the next century newspaper will be transmitted  electronically from thenational equivalents of Fleet Street (,) and printed out in our own homes. In fact, I'm pretty sure that that is how it will happen in future. You'll be probably selecting from a menu, making up your own _ by picking out the things you want to read and say. You might even have an intelligent screening device   to do the job for you.\nI think people have got it wrong when they talk about the competition between the different media. They actually have a relationship, feeding off each other. It was once predicted that television would kill off newspapers, which hasn't happened. What is read on the printed page is more enduring   than pictures on a flickering screen or sound lost in the sky. And as for the Internet, it's never really satisfying to read something just on a screen.", "label": "C"}

This time, she had been trying to report repeated cruel acts done by people faithful to the Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, who are in favour of Russia. In the past seven years, Politkovskaya had written dozens of accounts of life during wartime; many had been collected in her book \"A Small Corner of Hell: reports from Chechnya.\" Politkovskaya was far more likely to spend time in a hospital than on a battlefield, and her writing bore frequent witness to robbery, and the uncontrolled cruelty of life in a place that few other Russians--and almost no other reporters--cared to think about.", "label": "B"}

Europe's biggest online takeaway food company Just Eat has partnered with Starship Technologies to deliver food with robots on the streets of London later this month. \"Nobody has ever done deliveries with land-based robots,\" said Allan Martinson, the chief operating officer of Starship.\nThe robot courier can travel up to 4 miles per hour for about 10 miles. It uses a GPS signal and nine cameras to navigate . Instead of a person arriving at their door, customers could find themselves receiving a notification  on their phone that says a robot is on its way and a code to unlock the automated courier. \"Put the code in, the robot opens up, and there's your food,\" said David Buttress, chief manager of Just Eat.\nThe robot, which has so far been tested in Greenwich, Milton Keynes and Glastonbury, costs PS1 to transport within 3 miles, compared with the PS3 to PS6 it costs for a human courier. To date 30 robots have driven nearly 5,000 miles without getting into an accident or finding themselves picked on by passers-by. They have driven in more than 40 cities around the world, including London and Tallinn, Estonia.\nAn initial worry was how the public would react to robots. But Martinson said the public has been calm when passing the delivery machine on the streets. \"The most surprising reaction has been the lack of reaction,\" said Martinson.\nAnother significant fear was that people would disrupt  the robots, or try to steal them and their contents. To prevent this, the robot is fitted with nine cameras, two way audio, and movement sensors that send a warning if it is lifted off the ground. And it opens only with a pass code provided to the customer via a notification. \"It's much easier to shoplift than it is to steal a robot,\" said Martinson.", "label": "B"}

Occasionally, things are different.\nIn 1984, two men made an amazing discovery while working in a bog called Lindow Moss, in the north of England. A bog is a very wet area of earth, with a lot of plants growing in it. It can be like a very big and very thick vegetable soup--walk in the wrong place and you can sink and disappear forever. The men were working when one of them saw something sticking out--a human foot! Naturally, the men called the police, who then found the rest of the body. Was it a case of murder?

It was because he was in a very watery environment, safe from the bacteria that need oxygen to live. Also, the water in the bog was very acidic. The acid preserved the man's skin in the way that animal skin is preserved for leather coats and shoes.\nHow did he die? Understandably, archaeologists and other scientists wanted to know more about the person that they called \"Lindow Man\".

But in fact, almost everyone can invent. It's just that they do not recognize that their idea could be the start of an invention. \n    Once inventors see their ideas have some practical value, they don't let them slip away. \n    For example, the inventor of the dishwasher, American Josephine Cochrane, loved to give dinner parties. But she found it took too long to wash her dishes by hand and too many of them broke. She decided that a machine could do the job faster and with fewer mistakes. So, in 1886, she set out to make one for herself. \n    Like Cochrane's, most inventions are created to solve a problem. So, the first and most important step is to find the problem. \n    You can start by looking at what is wrong with things you use now. You can ask grandparents or neighbours if they remember ever saying: \"I wish someone would invent something for...\" Or you can look at people in different areas such as on the street, or at school. Then you might notice situations or things in need of improvement. \n    Remember to record your ideas and work. This will help you develop your invention and protect it when it is completed. \n    The next step is to think about possible solutions. An invention is a new way of solving a problem. So think of many, varied, and unusual ways. \n    You can often come up with a solution for a problem by looking at it from a different angle   or thinking about it in a new way. \n    Example 1 -- instead of thinking of shoes as protecting your feet from the ground, think of using something to protect the ground from your feet. \n    Example 2 -- instead of thinking about how you can carry oranges home from a store, think of how they can come to you by delivery or growing your own. \n    Example 3 -- instead of experimenting with only one solution, can you put two or three solutions together, or arrange them in different orders? \n    And if one solution doesn't work, can it be put to other uses? That was how yellow post-it notes (N) came about -- a \"failed\" adhesive   experiment proved a weak adhesive had good uses too! \n    After all, most inventions are not brand new. They do not come out of nowhere, but come out of things or ideas that already exist. \n And the hardest part of inventing, even for a lot of inventors, is coming up with a problem and finding a solution. Once you have an idea, you can always get help building your invention. \n     This problem-solving technique can also work in your everyday lives. So, why not try it in your studies, in your relationship with others, or even in the way you look at the world?", "label": "D"}

These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves.\nDecibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect.\nSome scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales.\nA team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected.\nMany researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels.

They form a natural border between Zimbabwe   and Zambia  .\nThe falls are named after Queen Victoria by Livingstone. They were known to the native people in the 18th century as: \"the smoke that thunders\". The waterfall is formed as the two-kilometer-wide Zambezi River spills   over the edge of its giant stone riverbed and falls into the gorge   below. At their highest point, the Victoria Falls drop a distance of 108m, almost twice as far as the Niagara Falls. As much as 546 million cubic meters of water per minute falls over the edge from that height.\nViewing the falls from the Zambian side means that visitors can follow a path that goes right up to the falls. The falls can also be viewed from the Boiling Pot, right in the depths of the gorge at the bottom of the falls. The 111-meter-high Victoria Falls Bridge, a railway crossing, is now a popular place for Bungee jumping. It can be crossed on foot for excellent views of the falls and the winding blue-green waters of the Zambezi River. It is also possible to see the falls from a plane.\nThe area around the falls is a major game-viewing place. The best time to view the Victoria Falls is between December and July, when the water level is the highest.

To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.\nFor a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world.\nThe tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse   on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation.\nToday there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be understood neither as superficial nor as artificial , but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.\nAs is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals and customs is the basis of all social inter-relationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to \"translate\" cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example when an American uses the word \"friend\", the cultural meanings of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor's language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to tell polite customs from individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue   that many Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.", "label": "D"}

Yet occurrences of shortages and droughts   are causing famine and distress in some areas, and industrial and agricultural by-products are polluting water supplies. Since the world's population is expected to double in the next 50 years, many experts think we are on the edge of a widespread water crisis.\nBut that doesn't have to be the outcome. Water shortages do not have to trouble the world---if we start valuing water more than we did in the past. Just as we began to appreciate petroleum more after the 1970s oil crises, today we must start looking at water from a fresh economic perspective. We can no longer afford to consider water a virtually free resource of which we can use as much as we like in any way we want.\nInstead, for all uses except the domestic demand of the poor, governments should price water to reflect its actual value. This means charging a fee for the water itself as well as for the supply costs.\nGovernments should also protect this resource by providing water in more economically and environmentally sound   ways. For example, often the cheapest way to provide irrigation water in the dry tropics is through small-scale projects, such as gathering rainfall in depressions   and pumping it to nearby cropland.\nNo matter what steps governments take to provide water more efficiently, they must change their institutional and legal approaches to water use. Rather than spread control among hundreds or even thousands of local, regional, and national agencies that watch various aspects of water use, countries should set up central authorities to coordinate   water policy.", "label": "A"}

This is quite different from many other animals , which depend heavily on smells.\nSince faces play such a crucial part in the social lives of monkeys , could this explain why certain monkey species have such colorful faces while others have simpler, plainer ones ?\nTo test this theory , a group of researchers from UCLA studied 139 monkey species , mainly from Asia and Africa, and analyzed hundreds of headshot  photos of those monkeys from their databases.\nIt was found that species that live in larger groups have faces with more complex color patterns than those that live in smaller groups. According to Live Science, researchers believe that this is nature's way of making it easier for monkeys to recognize each other since those living in larger groups have to distinguish between a greater number of faces.\nThis is actually not that hard to understand . Just imagine if there were 10 people standing in front of you, all wearing white clothes. It would be much more difficult to tell them apart than if they wore clothes with colorful patterns. However, if there were only two people that you had to identify, a lack of color wouldn't be much of a problem.\nApart from the need to recognize group members , researchers found that geography and environment also affect monkeys' facial colors. Species that live closer to the equator in thick, humid  forests were found to have darker faces than those who live in dry areas further away from the equator.

These tests are now included in almost all graduate recruitment   and are widely used in the selection of managers.\nThe most popular of these personality tests is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). It is based on the theory that we are born with a tendency to one personality type which stays more or less fixed throughout life. You answer 88 questions and are then given your \"type\", such as Outgoing or Quiet, Feeling or Thinking.\nCritics of personality testing raise doubts about \"social engineering\". Psychologist Dr. Colin Gill warns that the \"popular\" personality traits   have their disadvantages. \"People who are extremely open to new experiences can be butterflies, going from one idea to the next without mastering any of them.\" However, the psychometric test is here to stay, which may be why a whole sub-industry on cheating personality tests has sprung up. \"It's possible to cheat,\" admits Gill, \"but having to pretend to be the person you are at work will be tiring and unhappy and probably short-lived.\"\nSo can we change our personality? \"Your basic personality is fixed by the time you're 21,\"says Gill,\" but it can be affected by motivation and intelligence.

Consumers never use visual clues to decide how much should be paid. \nC. Getting something extra for free is better than getting the same for less. \nD. Consumers never rely on parts of the brains that aren't strictly quantitative.", "context": "You are careful with your money: you collect all kinds of coupons; look for group-buy deals if you eat out; you don't buy clothes unless in a sale. Does all this make you a wise consumer?\nLet's do the math first: you walk into a coffee shop and see two deals for a cup of coffee. The first deal offers 33 percent extra coffee. The second takes 33 percent off the  regular price. What's the better deal? Well, they are about the same, you'd think. And you'd be wrong. The deals appear to be equal, but in fact, they are different. Here's the math: Let's say the standard coffee is 10 yuan and let's divide the amount of coffee into three portions . That makes about 3.3 yuan per portion, The first deal gets you 4 portions for 10 yuan (2.5 yuan per portion) and the second gets you 3 portions of coffee for 6.6 yuan (2.2 yuan per portion) and is therefore a better deal.\nIn a new study published by the Journal of Marketing, participants were asked the same question, and most of them chose the first deal, the Atlantic website reported. Why? Because getting something extra for free feels better than getting the same for less. The applications of this view into consumer psychology  are huge. Instead of offering direct discounts, shops offer larger sizes or free samples.\nAccording to the study, the reason why these marketing tricks work is that consumers don't really know how much anything should cost, so we rely on parts of our brains that  aren't strictly quantitative.\nThere are some traps we should be aware of when shopping. First of all, we are heavily influenced by the first number. Suppose you are shopping in Hong Kong. You walk into Hermes, and you see a 100,000 yuan bag. \"That's crazy.\" You shake your head and leave. The next shop is Gucci, a handbag here costs 25,000 yuan. The price is still high, but compared to the 100,000 yuan price tag you just committed to your memory, this is a steal. Stores often use the price difference to set consumers' expectation. zxxk\nAnother trap we often fall to Is that we are not really sure what things are worth. And so we use clues  to tell us what we ought to pay for them. US economist Dan Ariely has done an experiment to prove this. According to the Atlantic, Ariely pretended he was giving a lecture on poetry. He told one group of students that the tickets cost money and another group that they would be paid to attend. Then he informed both groups that thelecture was free. The first group was anxious to attend, believing they were getting something of value for free. The second group mostly declined, believing they were being forced to volunteer for the same event without reward.\nWhat's a lecture on poetry by an economist worth? The students had no idea. That's  the point. Do we really know what a shirt is worth ? What about a cup of coffee? What's the worth of a life insurance.policy? Who knows? Most of us don't. As a result, our shopping  brain uses only what is knowable:  visual  clues, invited emotions, comparisons, and  a sense of bargain. We are not stupid. We are just easily influenced.", "label": "C"}

I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus.\nAnd I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty.\nHappily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.\nWhen my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced.\nAs a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. \"Animals belong in the wild,\" is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer?\nGenerally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad.\nNot that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world.\nConsequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?", "label": "D"}

This year is off to a fast start with 40 so far--more than in most years for that time period.\nBut that's because the 8.8 quake in Chile generated a large number of strong aftershocks, and so many quakes early this year skews   the picture, said Paul Earle, a US seismologist  .\nAlso, it's not the number of quakes, but their devastating impacts  that gain attention, with the death tolls   largely due to construction standards (building standard) and crowding, Earle added. \"The standard mantra   is earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do, \" he said. Ks*5*u\nThere have been more deaths over the past decades from earthquakes, said University of Colorado geologist Roger Bilham. In an opinion column last month in the journal Nature, Bilham called for better construction standards in the world's big cities.\nOf the 130 cities worldwide with populations of more than 1 million, more than half are prone   to earthquakes, Bilham said.\nDeveloping nations, where populations are growing, don't pay attention to earthquake preparedness, Bilham said.\" If you have a problem feeding yourself, you're not really going to worry about earthquakes.\"\nAnother reason quakes seem worse is that we're paying attention more. The Haiti earthquake quickly followed by the 8.8 in Chile made everyone start to think.\nBut it won't last, said US disaster researcher Deniis Mileti. \"People are paying attention to the violent planet we've always lived on,\" Mileti said.\" Come back in another six months if there has been no earthquakes, most people will have forgotten it again. \"", "label": "D"}

Where the old can go to get their pensions.", "context": "A serious problem for today's society is who should be responsible for our elderly and how to improve their lives. It is not only a financial problem but also a question of the system we want for our society. I would like to suggest several possible solutions to this problem.\nFirst, employers should take the responsibility for their retired employees. To make this possible, a percentage of profits should be set aside for this purpose. But when a company must take life-long responsibility for its employees, it may suffer from a commercial disadvantage due to higher employee costs.\nAnother way of solving the problem is to return the responsibility to the individual. This means each person must save during his working years to pay for his years of retirement. This does not seem a very fair model since some people have enough trouble paying for their daily life without trying to earn extra to cover their retirement years. This means the government might have to step in to care for the poor.\nIn addition, the government could take responsibility for the care of the elderly. This could be financed through government taxes to increase the level of pensions. Furthermore, some institutions should be created for senior citizens, which can help provide a comfortable life for them. Unfortunately, as the present situation in our country shows, this is not a truly _ answer. The government can seldom afford to care for the elderly, particularly when it is busy trying to care for the young.\nOne further solution is that the government or social organizations establish some working places especially for the elderly where they are independent.\nTo sum up, all these options have advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that some combination of these options may be needed to provide the care we hope to give to our elderly generations.", "label": "C"}

To let meeting people become easier and more comfortable. \nD. To learn a language.", "context": "In most languages, a greeting is usually followed by \"small talk\". Small talk means the little things we talk about at start of a conversation. In English-speaking countries people often make small talk about the weather: \"Nice day, isn't it?\" But there is something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable. People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safer topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk in English. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place. At football matches, people make small talk about the game they are watching: \"Great game, isn't it?\" At bus stops, people may comment about the transport system: \"The bus service is terrible, isn't it?\"\nGreetings and small talk are important parts of conversation in any language. The way people greet each other and the things they talk about, however, may be different from one language to another. This shows that there is much more to learn when we learn a language than just the vocabulary and the grammar of the language. We also have to learn the social behavior of the people who speak it.", "label": "C"}

If you say thank you, for even the smallest gift or slightest show of kindness, you'll fell happy.\nGratitude , says Robert A. Emmons, a professor of psychology at the University of California, is an extremely important element of happiness, In his most recent book, Thanks! (Houghton Mifflin, $30.95), Emmons uses the first major study on gratitude to prove mom's point. In acknowledging and promoting this much-ignored expression of thankfulness, he explains how people have benefited --even improved their health.\nAs one of the leading scholars of the positive psychology movement, he admits gratitude may be difficult to express. He recommends you begin by acknowledging that life is good and full of events and elements that make daily existence a wonder.\nSecond, recognize that the source of life's goodness is more than just you. That source may be your mom, a friend, partner, child, colleague at work or play, a caregiver or God --or any combination of these.\nExpressing gratitude should not be a reaction. Instead, it should be a state of mind, To feel grateful when life is a breeze and you have more than what you need is easy, To be grateful in times of crisis --anger, hatred and bitterness--is easier. Also, too many people are aware of life's blessings only after these are lost.\nIt's crisis and chaos--danger, disease, disability and death -- that bring many individuals to realize just how dependent they are on others. Yet it's the way each of us begins life and ends it. It's too hard that so many people waste those decades in between laboring under the illusion  that they are self-sufficient, says Emmons.\nI'm not a reader or advocate of self-help books, but I am thankful for the reference I found in a newspaper article to the research Emmons was conducting on gratitude involving organ donors and recipients . The chance discovery led me to this book.\nMom implied that kindness seems to find its way back to the giver because life really is all about giving, receiving and repaying.

Scientists now say that your answers to these questions may depend on your genes. \nNew research suggests that a gene called \"period 3\" influences how well you function without sleep. The \"period 3\" gene comes in two forms: short and long. Everyone has two copies of the gene. So, you may have two longs, two shorts, or one of each. Your particular combination depends on what your parents passed on to you.\nScientists from the University of Surrey in England studied 24 people who had either two short or two long copies of \"period 3\". Study participants   had to stay awake for 40 hours straight. Then, they took tests that measured how quickly they pushed a button when numbers flashed   on a screen and how well they could remember lists of numbers.\nResults showed that the people with the short form of \"period 3\" performed much better on these tests than the people with the long form did. In both groups, people performed worst in the early morning. \nAfter the first round of experiments, participants were finally allowed to sleep. People in the group that performed well on the tests (those with the short form of \"period 3\") took about 18 minutes to nod off.\nWhile people with the long \"period 3\" gene fell asleep in just 8 minutes.

Current scientific consensus suggests that intelligence is controlled by genes, with environmental factors such as schooling and nutrition playing a partial role up to this age. After this point, IQ scores stabilize  .\nBut James Flynn, professor of political studies and psychology at the University of Otago in New Zealand, argues that people can \"upgrade\" their own intelligence throughout their lives. He believes intellectual stimulation   from others is crucial as the \"brain seems to be rather like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets\". However, the opposite is also true - so people sharing a home or workplace with those who are intellectually challenged risk seeing their IQ levels fall as a result.\nHe found the \"understanding quality\" of a family changes the IQs of all members, especially children. It can \"lift\" or hold back, depending on the \"gap between their brightness and that of their siblings and parents\". A bright ten-year-old with brothers and sisters of average intelligence will suffer a five to ten point IQ disadvantage, compared to a similar child with equally bright siblings. However, children with a low IQ could gain six to eight points by having brighter siblings and special educational treatment to help pull them up.\nProfessor Flynn also concluded that although genetics and early life experiences determine about 80 percent of intelligence, the remaining 20 percent is linked to lifestyle. This means that people can raise their IQ, or allow it to fall, by ten points or more. Therefore, the best way to boost IQ level is to mix with bright friends, find an intellectually challenging job and marry someone cleverer.", "label": "D"}

It is accurate to say that each of us has our own ideas of success to the extent that each of us is responsible for setting our own goals and determining whether we have met these goals satisfactorily. Because each of us possesses unique differences in genetic ability and favorable environments in which to express these abilities, it is necessarily true that we must define success broadly.\nFor some people,simply being able to live their life with the least misery and sufferings is considered a success. Think of the peace of mind of the poor shepherd who tends his sheep, enjoys his simple life with his family in the beauty of nature, and who is respected because he does a good job of achieving the goals expected of him and accepted by his family and his society. On the other hand, it seems that even though some people appear to be rich in material possessions, many of them seem to be miserable and consider themselves unsuccessful when judged by their own standards of success. Because not all ventures can be successful, one should not set unrealistic goals for achieving success, but if one has self-confidence it would be unfortunate to set one's goals at too low a level of achievement.\nA wise man once said to a young man who was experiencing frustration with his own professional success, \"You do not have to set your goal to reach the moon in order to have success in traveling.

Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers.\nHome schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours.\nThanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools.\nIf you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \"Will home schools really work for my children?\"\nFact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.)\nCollectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college.\nOne study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons.\nFor more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.", "label": "C"}

Kennedy--sat down, as a frontrunner for the Senate seat in New York, for a televised interview that helped decide the future of her campaign. The result was a disaster.\nHer performance wasn't well received, in part because her speech was full of filler words--\"ums,\" \"ahs\" and \"you knows.\" One listener counted 27 \"ums\" and 38 \"you knows\" in the space of five minutes. A few weeks after the interview, Kennedy ended her Senate campaign.\nFiller words may seem natural in everyday speech, but they can be deadly in formal presentations. \"Using excessive fillers is the most annoying speech habit,\" said Susan Ward, a speech specialist. \"They take your listener's attention away often to the point that he doesn't hear anything you say. Your message is entirely lost.\"\nMany speakers are afraid of pause. They believe their audience will think they are inarticulate   if they pause to think of what to say next, so they use filler words to avoid the silence. However, a pause is actually more impressive than a filler word. Listeners know that the speaker is thinking, trying to find the right word. Sometimes a pause can actually improve a speech, as when an actor uses a dramatic pause to hold the attention of his audience. A speaker shouldn't be afraid to pause occasionally during a speech; it shows self-confidence.\nIt takes some work to cut out filler words. You can begin by taking a few seconds to think about what you want to say the next time you are asked a question. This pause will help you begin powerfully, and it will help you avoid using a filler word.\nThe same public speaking technique applies when you are shifting from one idea to another. While you may be tempted to fill the silence between ideas with a filler word, remember to allow yourself to pause and think about what you want to say next.\nIf you need help overcoming your \"um\" problem, consider asking a family member or a friend to point out when you use filler words. You also could record an upcoming presentation and then watch yourself in action. You may be amazed at how often you say \"um\" or \"uh\"!\nAlthough we live in a fast-paced society that seemingly demands instant answers, we must use the pause to our advantage. Finally, we should only speak when we are ready.", "label": "B"}

Though she put in long hours as Vice President at a Fortune 500 company, she also found time to professional and community organizations.\nThen last year, the unexpected thing happened. The company where she'd worked for more than 20 years was bought out and she was laid off.\nOn hearing the news, those who she served were quick not only to offer her support--but actual jobs! In the end, Mulcahy was hired by a PR agency--she used to work as a director of her industry association. And she brought with her several accounts based on relationships she had formed through volunteering.\nVolunteering was a godsend to Todd, who has been a mid-level manager at the same company for many years. After he was out of work, he felt old and disappointed. But Todd knew he needed a change. Todd became involved in community service.

Although little remains of the property, the team, led by Birmingham Archaeology, believes it has identified a dust hole used by the 16th century poet.\nSmall pieces of pottery   and broken clay pipe have already been found from a muddy hole on the site, which they claim could yield some of the most significant discoveries about Shakespeare in decades. The dig focuses on three areas of the property, which Shakespeare bought in 1597 when he returned to his home town from London having achieved fame -- including the so-called knot garden at the back of the building.\nDr Diana Owen, Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which owns the site, said, \"We do not know if the knot garden was an area used by Shakespeare -- it may have been a yard simply used by his servants. But this could actually yield some fantastic results, especially if it was an area where rubbish was thrown or the dust hole was located.\"\nKevin Colls, from Birmingham Archaeology,added, \"Through documentary evidence we know Shakespeare lived at New Place but we have very little information regarding the layout   of the house and gardens at this time. Through archaeological fieldwork, in particular the dig of structural remains and the recovery of artifacts, we hope to fill in the blanks.\"\nUntil October, visitors will be able to watch archaeologists and volunteers at work as they excavate the remains of the house, which was knocked down in 1759.

The 31-year-old resident of North Little Rock, Arkansas, waited for about six hours at a nearby medical center while the medical staff there called all over town -- even as far away as Dallas and Memphis -- to find a hand surgeon to reattach his finger. Finally, a willing doctor was located in Louisville, Kentucky. But even though Bleed had insurance , he would have to hire a private plane to get himself there, at a cost of $4,300. In the end, he charged the cost to two credit cards, and his finger was saved. His insurance company eventually covered the cost of the plane, but his experience makes people aware of the fact that trauma  care in the United States is not only geographically limited, but in many places, non-existent.\nOnly eight states -- New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, New Mexico, California, Oregon, and Washington -- have local, fully functional trauma systems. The remaining states have partial systems, and 12 -- including Arkansas -- have no trauma system at all.\nAlthough the President has signed a bill of $12 million for the purpose of supporting trauma care systems nationwide, many in Congress  are unwilling to spend government money for a service they think should be paid for by states, says Wayne Meredith, medical director for trauma programs at the American College of Surgeons. Meanwhile, many states have also failed to find the dollars to support trauma systems. To make matters worse, many people without insurance depend heavily on the emergency care services, placing a huge financial burden on the medical centers that serve them.\nFor the same reason, doctors, too, often go unpaid. They are unwilling to perform emergency care, worsening critical shortages of neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and hand surgeons -- the very types of specialists Bleed needed at short notice.\nSupporting a trauma care system doesn't take much. A half-penny sales tax in Miami-Dade County makes its outstanding system work. In Arkansas alone, says Wayne Meredith, a well-funded trauma system would possibly prevent 200 to 600 deaths each year. If trauma care systems were to work well across the nation, experts say, many thousands of lives each year could be saved. \"You don't get much better return on your investment than that,\" Meredith says.", "label": "B"}

So, what went wrong?\nAs a young boy, Jack went to Westminster School, but after only one year he was expelled for fighting with a teacher. He was then sent to Harrow School but only lasted three days before he was also thrown out. He was eventually educated by private tutors.\nAfter school, Jack went to Cambridge University. He arrived with 2,000 bottles of port, but left without graduating - he found university life boring. Later, he joined the army, enlisting with the 7th Hussars. As a young officer, he spent a year with the regiment in France as part of the occupation force after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. Jack passed the time gambling and drinking before resigning his commission. At the age of 21, he returned to his country house just in time to receive his inheritance.\nWith an annual income of over PS800,000 in today's money, Jack was extremely rich... but it didn't take him long to spend it all. In 1819, he became an MP. In order to secure his seat, he offered voters PS10 notes to vote for him, spending more than PS10,000 in total. However, he found politics dull and went to parliament only once. Back at home, he would often drop bank notes in the gardens of his estate, and gave his servants vast amounts of spending money. Once he lost his racetrack winnings (several thousand pounds) when the wind blew all the money away.\nOne of Jack's favorite pastimes was hunting. He would go in any kind of weather, occasionally with no clothes on. Sometimes, he would get up in the middle of the night, take off with a gun to look for something to shoot. \nJack also kept a large number of pets. These included about 2,000 dogs. Some were fed on steak and Champagne and even wore livery. A favorite horse had free range inside Halston Hall and would often lie with Jack in front of the fire.\nJack was a bit of a practical joker, too. He once left a horse in the bedroom of a guest. Another visitor fell asleep and woke up to find a live bear and two bulldogs in his bed. In 1826, as a result of a bet, Jack rode his horse into the Bedford Hotel, up the grand staircase and onto the balcony. Then, still sitting on the horse, he jumped off the balcony, landing among the diners in the restaurant below.\nAnother time, he invited a local doctor to dine at Halston Hall. As soon as the doctor had left, Jack put on a highwayman's costume and raced ahead to rob the unsuspecting man. On another occasion, a passenger in Jack's carriage admitted that he'd never been in an accident, so Jack drove the carriage up a hill and turned it over. He would also slip red-hot coals into people's pockets as a joke.\nEventually, Jack ran out of money and fell into debt. In 1830, he fled to France to avoid his creditors , but returned a couple of years later, ending up in prison in Southwark, London. Jack died there in 1834, a poor, lonely man.

According to \"Music and Emotions\", electronic music with loud sounds will physically affect you more easily than any other type of music. Certain types of music can give you courage and strengthen your willpower, while other types can make you relaxed.

One phenomenon that is dreaded in the United States is telemarketing. Telemarketers call your phone in order to try and convince you to buy their products. They often start the conversation with a friendly voice or tone to try and convince you they can be trusted. Once most people realize they are talking to a telemarketer, they will end the conversation as quickly as possible.  Some will be polite and make up an excuse to end the conversation. Others are less tactful and criticize the telemarketer, yell at them, or simply hang up the phone. Although most people don't buy things from telemarketers, a few people do, so telemarketers keep on calling. If you have a phone in America you most likely have received a call from a telemarketer.\nTo avoid telemarketers some people buy new technology.  \"Caller ID\" allows you to see the number that is calling your phone before you answer.

Nowadays, it is quite possible to eat both well and heartily all over the island.\nTourism has made a  _ difference to the standards of cooking inIreland. Until recently there was hardly any tradition of eating out in many districts, except perhaps on very few occasions at a local hotel. Patterns of diet were old-styled, based firmly on 'meat and two vegetables' (somewhat overcooked), potatoes (of course) and large quantities of dairy produce. Now things are very different. Tourist demands for predictable, inexpensive fast-food are met, as everywhere, with hamburgers and pizzas - a better bet being fish and chips. But more sophisticated tastes have introduced wholefoods and vegetarian restaurants (almost unheard of before), and a vast number of new restaurants, often French in style, have opened in the main tourist centres. Food 'events' such as Kinsale's Gourmet festival or Galway's Oyster Festival attract large numbers of visitors and reflect the new interest in food.\nWhatever Irish cooking lacks in finesse , it nearly always makes up for in plenty, and ingredients  are of a high quality. Home-grown produce includes rich dairy foods, beef, lamb and pork, and a great variety of seafood. One of its great specialities is soda bread. It is made with buttermilk and is served fresh and warm with every meal.

They had accepted a telephone order to buy PS 100,000 worth of shares  from a fifteen-year-old schoolboy (they thought he was twenty-one). The shares fell in value and the schoolboy was unable to pay up. The bank lost PS 20,000 on the deal which it cannot get back because, for one thing, this young speculator  does not have the money and, for another, being under eighteen, he is not legally liable for his debts. If the shares had risen in value by the same amount that they fell, he would have pocketed PS 20,000 profit. Not bad for a fifteen-year-old. It certainly is better than delivering the morning newspaper. In another recent case, a boy of fourteen found, in his grandmother's house, a suitcase full of foreign banknotes. The clean, crisp, banknotes looked very convincing but they were now not used in their country of origin or anywhere else. This young boy headed straight to the nearest bank with his pockets filled with notes. The cashiers did not realise that the country in question had reduced the value of its currency by 90%. They exchanged the notes the notes at their face value at the current exchange rate. In three days, before he was found out, he took PS 200,000 from nine different banks. Amazingly, he had already spent more than half of this on taxi-rides, restaurant meals, concert tickets and presents for his many new girlfriends (at least he was generous!) before the police caught up with him. Because he is also under eighteen the banks have kissed goodbye to a lot of money, and several cashiers  have lost their jobs.\nShould we admire these youngsters for being enterprising  and showing initiative  or condemn them for their dishonesty? Maybe they had managed for years with tiny amounts of pocket money that they got from tight-fisted parents. Maybe they had done Saturday jobs for peanuts. It is hardly surprising, given the expensive things that young people want to buy, such as fashionable running shoes and computer games, if they sometimes think up more imaginative ways of making money than delivering newspapers and baby-sitting. These lads saw the chance to make a lot of money and took it.\nAnother recent story which should give us food for thought is the case of the man who paid his six-year-old daughter PS 300 a week pocket money. He then charged her for the food she ate and for her share of the rent and household bills. After paying for all this, she was left with a few coins for her piggy bank. \"She will soon learn the value of money,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as a free lunch. Everything has to be paid for and the sooner she learns that the better.\" At the other extreme there are fond parents who provide free bed and board for their grown-up children. While even the most hard-hearted parents might hesitate to throw their children out on the streets, we all know people in their late twenties who still shamelessly live off their parents.

Not only is it deadly poisonous --- though that doesn't stop people trying to eat it --- but it is also able to scare off enemies by inflating itself to become much larger than normal, when it is young it even chews on its own brothers and sisters.\nTiger puffer fish attach their eggs to rocks near the bottom of the sea, often at the mouths of bays. Then the larvae   move to the entries of rivers and lakes once they have grown a little. Then, having put on a lot of weight, they head out to sea. There's no innocent childhood for the puffer fish, as Shin Oikawa of Kyushu University in Japan and his colleagues found out when they put the larvae of tiger puffer fish in the lab and monitored them for two months. They found that the larvae went through three steps in which their metabolic  rates increased dramatically when they reached body weights of 0.002g, 0.01g, and 0.1g. When a larva went through one of these steps, its behavior also changed. For instance, once a larva had passed the first level it would have grown its first tooth and could start attacking larvae that had not yet reached that stage. Similarly, any larva that had reached the 0.01g or 0.1g levels would start attacking lighter larvae.\nThe researchers noted that the baby fish had a \"relatively small mouth\", so rather than swallowing their brothers and sisters whole, they would bite pieces out of them. Despite this limitation, the fish caused plenty of deaths --- up to 12 per cent of the deaths that happened in the lab each day.\nThose fish that grew fast enough to be able to chew on their fellows had an advantage. The extra food accelerated their growth and development. Tiger puffer fish are likely to be faster and swifter, so they can deal better with enemies.\nAs the name suggests, puffer fish can inflate to make themselves seem much larger than they really are, thus scaring off enemies. They do this by filling their stomachs, which are extremely elastic , with water. If that's not enough of a threat, the tiger puffer fish --- like most of the other puffer fish in the family --- carries a deadly toxin . Eat one puffer fish and the poison will paralyze   your muscles, including the muscles responsible for breathing, so death is usually caused by a lack of oxygen. Famously, the fish is a delicacy in Japan, where highly qualified chefs produce dishes that contain the safe level of the poison. Interestingly, the puffer fish does not go to the trouble of producing the poison itself. Instead, it hosts bacteria   that produce the stuff. It obtains these bacteria from its diet, so the youngest adult fish are not poisonous.", "label": "A"}

Election of president.", "context": "With the possible exception of equal rights, perhaps the most heated argument across the United States today is the death penalty  . Many argue that it is an effective deterrent   to murder , while others think there is no enough proof that the death penalty reduces the number of murders. The argument advanced by those who are against the death penalty is that it is cruel and inhuman punishment, that it is a mark of a bad society and finally that it is of questionable effectiveness as a deterrent   to crime   anyway.\nIn our opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action. Throughout recorded history there have always been those peculiar persons in every society who made terrible crimes such as murder. But some are more dangerous than others. For example, it is one thing to take the life of another in time of blind anger, but quite another to coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people in the style of a butcher. Thus, murder, like all other crimes, is a matter of different degree. While it could be argued with some reason that the criminal in the first instance should be merely kept from society, such should not be the fate of the latter type murderer.\nThe value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime may be open to discussion. But the majority of people believe that the death penalty protects them. Their belief is proved by the fact that the death penalty prevents murder. For example, from 1954 to 1963, when the death penalty was carried out from time to time in California, the murder rate remained between three and four murders for each 100, 000 population. Since 1964 the death penalty has been done only once, and the murder rate has risen to10.4 murders for each 100, 000 population. The sharp climb in the state's murder rate, which began when killings stopped, does not happen by chance. It certainly shows that the death penalty does stop many murderers. If the law about death penalty is vetoed  , some people will be murdered----some whose lives may have been saved if the death penalty were in effect. This is really a life or death matter.

They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food.\nAn ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators.\nIn addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish.\nThis could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply.\nThere is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.  It is estimated that if the bears cannot adapt to changing climates, they might die out before the end of the 21stcentury, with about 50% of the animals disappearing by 2050. So time is running out!\nThere are some things that may help slow down global warming and help delay extinction of polar bears.  These include finding new energy sources that don't give off greenhouse gases and not making any more incursions into polar bear's territory.", "label": "A"}

Astronomers last week discovered a pair of enormous black holes far out in the galaxy that appear to be dancing toward each other. However, astronomers say the collision is not likely to occur for several million years.\nBlack holes are objects in outer space that are so dense that nothing can escape their gravity. They often sit in the center of a galaxy -- like the Milky Way --and suck up everything near them. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so intense that not even light (Which travels faster than anything else in space) can make it past without being swallowed.\nBlack holes, like the one at the center of the Milky Way, are enormous. Scientists call some of them \"supermassive\", because they can be a few million times the size of most stars. Their size, their mass, and their inescapable gravity make black holes a giant force of nature in outer space.\nBecause there is no light near black holes, astronomers cannot actually see them; they are completely invisible to us on the Earth. Scientists manage to detect the existence of a black hole by watching what happens to other objects, or matter floating in space.\nSo how did scientists manage to get a good look at a region so faraway? The team used an orbiting NASA observatory known as Chandra. This special observatory uses X-rays rather than light to watch far out into space. Right before a star gets sucked into a black hole, it produces a large number of X-rays.", "label": "A"}

Many times, I look at contemporary Indian art - either in real art galleries or in virtual art galleries on the Web to improve my mood. I particularly like the paintings with vibrant colors or ones which present a calm landscape using gentle colors.\nArt therapy   uses the creation or viewing of art to help people discover and express their feelings. Unlike art for art's sake, which focuses on the finished piece, art therapy focuses on the process of creation itself. Art therapists believe that the act of making a piece of art _ internal activity that contributes to physical, emotional and spiritual healing. For people who are not able or ready to create art, going to an art museum or looking through art books or virtual art galleries can also be helpful. Simply viewing art refreshes the spirit and promotes relaxation.\nArt therapy is helpful in healing in various ways. The aesthetic quality of the work produced can lift a person's mood, boost self-awareness, improve self-esteem and increase self-confidence. Also, research shows that physiological functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration , become slow when people are deeply involved in an activity they enjoy.\nBecause art therapy uses a language other than words, it is often employed in treating patients with physical or emotional illnesses who have difficulty talking about their fears or hopes, or about their anger and other strong emotions. The creation of art helps people get in touch with thoughts and feelings that are often hidden from the conscious mind.\nStress reduction is also a significant benefit. Studies have shown that repressing strong feelings can lead to a buildup of stress, and that stress can intensify pain and the symptoms of various diseases.

Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated.\nSkeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner.\nIt is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush.\nThe fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker.\nMore broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home.

While a typical fruit fly slept for an average of 927 minutes a day, the mutant flies slept for just 317. They also slept for shorter periods of time, and slept and woke more frequently.\n\"The results showed a great loss of both the time that the flies' sleep lasted and their ability to remain asleep after they slept,\" says researcher Nicholas Stavropoulos.\nThe researchers also examined the link between sleep and lifespan, finding that flies with mutations to the insomniac gene lived only about two-thirds as long as unchanged flies. But when the scientists removed insomniac only inneurons ---allowing it to remain in the rest of the flies' bodies---this difference disappeared; the resulting animals slept poorly but lived just as long.\n\"This suggests that reduced sleep can be 'uncoupled'  from reduced lifespan, supporting the idea that some interruptions of sleep do not affect overall health, at least as far as lifespan is concerned,\" Stavropoulos says.\nAlthough flies and humans would appear to have little in common when it comes to lifestyle, scientists say that the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness are likely to be quite similar.\n\"Sleep is a fundamental behavior in all animals, and it is poorly understood from a scientific standpoint, says Stavropoulos.

Dishonesty often helps them survive.\nMany kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator   gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.\nAnother kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub  jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.\nBirds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them.\n _ After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other.

When chimps find food that they love, such as\nbananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them, and they don't need to share their food.\nAs children, many of us learn the saying \"You can't fool Mother Nature.\" But maybe you can't trust her, either.", "label": "B"}

Tui Na treatment is easy for people to master. \nD. Tui Na treatment is the most suitable for those living in China", "context": "In traditional Chinese medicine, the body, mind and spirit cannot be divided and so the unique whole-body treatment in Tui Na can also be a useful treatment correcting any imbalances in the body's energy before symptoms and disease can develop. It also works to bring back emotional peace as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people \"feel good\". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses.\nTui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists , by using a variety of movements, will control the intensity  and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult movements to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body.\nStress  Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress.\nIt spreads the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tight muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your energy flowing inside your body is balanced, you feel relaxed and comfortable. Tui Na is especially useful for  _ shoulders and tight neck muscles.\nEmotions  In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ  is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the related emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist  . But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na, one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself. But if one does need to pour out his/her worries or troubles, an active dialogue between the psychotherapist and the patient will help to get a better effect.\nOrgans & Emotions  Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the liver  , the lungs, and etc.--are linked to a relevant emotion.\nThe heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day.\nThe stomach is connected with too much thinking or worrying about anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all.\nThe liver is linked to anger. In Chinese medicine, the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The lung rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness  , while if there is too little, it can bring about indecision. When there is a history of depression with a patient, it may have effect on the liver. ks5u\nTui Na can help release most of the discomfort and it is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method for the balance of your energy flowing, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese medicine.", "label": "B"}

Revolution on the farm", "context": "Today just as technology changed the face of industry, farmers have undergone an \"agricultural revolution\". On the farm of today, machines provide all the power.\nOne of the most important benefits will be the farm computer. A few forward-looking farmers are already using computers to help them run their farms more efficiently. The computers help them keep more accurate records so they can make better decisions on what crops to plant, how much livestock to buy, when to sell their products, and how much profit they can expect. Many computer companies have been developing special computer programs just for farmers. Programs are being written for hog  producers, grain farmers, potato farmers, and dairy farmers. In the future, farmers will be able to purchase computer programs made to their needs. Because of the growing importance of computers on the farm, students at agricultural colleges are required to take computer classes in addition to their normal agricultural courses. There can be no doubt that farmers will rely on computers even more in the future. While the old-time farm depended on horse power, and modern farms depend on machine power, farms of the future will depend on computer power.\nAnother technological advance which is still in the experimental stage is the robot, a real \"mechanized hired hand\" that will be able to move and, in some ways, think like a human being. Unlike farmers of the present, farmers of the future will find that many day-to-day tasks will be done for them. Scientists are now developing robots that will be able to shear  sheep, drive tractors, and harvest fruit. Even complex jobs will be done by robots. For example, in order to milk their cows, farmers must first drive them into the special barn , then connect them to the milking machines, watch the machines, and disconnect them when they are finished. In the future, this will all be done by robots. In addition, when the milking is completed, the robots will automatically check to make sure that the milk is pure. The complete mobilization of the farm is far in the future, but engineers expect that some robots will be used before long.", "label": "D"}

They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths.\nAs fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree.\nRing counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring.\nThe daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring.\nThorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history.\nIn the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles.\nThis is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean.

In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her.\nIt was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road.\nBy now it was far too late even to try to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30, so we decided to return to Cambridge.

In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger.\nWhen they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people.\nWhat tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth.\nA tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously.\nIt isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger.\nTigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals.

Speed skates typically offer lightweight plates to reduce exhaustion for skating long distances. Jam skates have preferred speed skates because they offer a similar design and freedom of movement. The most obvious difference is that a speed skate features a toe stop, unlike a jam skate that uses a toe plug.\nRhythm Skates\nRhythm skates are similar to jam skates.

The finding suggests that like an understanding friend, dogs can see if we are happy, sad, pleased or angry.\nWhen humans look at a new face, their eyes usually look across the left, falling on the right hand side of the person's face first.

Low ceilings, on the other hand, may inspire a more detailed outlook.\nIn additions to ceiling height, the view afforded by a building may influence an occupant's ability to concentrate.

Tanner and his team found that students in classrooms with unblocked views of at least 50 feet outside the window had higher scores on tests of vocabulary, language arts and maths than did students whose classrooms primarily overlooked roads and parking lots.\nRecent study on room lighting design suggests than dim  light helps people to loosen up.

But you can't possibly understand Shakespeare's language if you're just reading it in your head. Shakespeare is difficult; it's not a 21stcentury text. You have to use different ways to understand it.\nThe new teaching way focuses on how actors come to understand Shakespeare's language. In fact actors have the same nervousness about Shakespeare's language as young people in schools do. But in six to eight weeks they get to a place of complete confidence about the play. Pupils can do as well.\nExercises devised are to let children aged 11 to 14 imitate the methods of professional actors. Written and oral assessments developed alongside the lessons will show how well students have understood the texts.\nIn one task pupils will work on creating four key physical figures of king, warrior , lover and joker, finding which lines of their chosen character go with those features first and then acting them out. Through this they can examine how a character such as Macbeth can switch dramatically within one scene from soldier to kingly figure to trick planner. It's really creative but you're still getting a really wonderful model of understanding. _ \nEducators think Shakespeare should be a central part of every young person's education.

But when it happens in front of the television cameras, it can become an internet sensation.\nDo you think there's anything funny about spicy meat? Swiss finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz seemed to think it was hilarious. Mr. Merz was making a speech in the Swiss parliament on meat imports when he started laughing and couldn't stop. The meat in question is known as \"bundnerfleisch\"-- a type of air-dried beef product. Herr Merz later admitted that he was amused by the bureaucratic  language in which the bill was written.\nSince then, Mr. Merz has become an internet hit. A video of the incident shows a grey-suited minister giggling away, accompanied by applause from his parliamentary colleagues. So far, the video has been seen by more than 500,000 people on YouYube and other websites. \"I don't understand what he's talking about,\" said one viewer, \"but it's just so funny.\" The recent publicity will be good news for the minister, too. Mr. Merz had been criticized recently for signing away much of Switzerland's banking secrecy, and for failing to do enough to help two Swiss citizens who were detained by Libya. But now, with retirement a few months away, Mr. Merz may leave on a high note. Some even suggest he may have a future career as a comedian.\nOf course, Mr. Merz isn't the first person to  _ on air. BBC Radio 4 newsreader Charlotte Green lost control on the programmeTodaynot so long ago. It all happened after a clip of the oldest known recording of the human voice was played. A studio member remarked that the 1860 recording of a woman singing the French song \"Au Clair de la Lune\" sounded like a \"bee buzzing in a bottle\". That seemed to set Ms. Green off as she broke down into a fit of the giggles. Later, the editor of the show, Ceri Thomas, said most listeners who contacted the show had commented on \"how much they had enjoyed the moment\". He added, \"When Charlotte loses it, she really loses it.\"\nSo, why do we get these fits of laughter? Experts say it's a form of release. Nervous tension often builds up inside us, especially in those who have got high-pressure, stressful jobs. When stressed out, the body constricts  blood vessels, elevates the production of potentially damaging stress hormones, and raises blood pressure. Short periods of stress are normal and not dangerous, but over long periods of time stress weakens the immune system and makes heart problems more likely. Under the control ofself-protecting mechanisms of human body, this pressure needs an outlet, usually manifesting itself through tears, anger or laughter-- uncontrollable fits of laughter!\nSo, beware! That uncontrollable laughing fit could strike at any moment.\n[(<<>> 201102 \"Laugh Away\")]", "label": "B"}

After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired, and motivated to work towards a common goal.\nAn effective leader makes others feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing. The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve, and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it. One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture, so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result.\nGood leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future. Their enthusiasm wins them plenty of supporters who help make their vision a reality.\nGood leaders also understand that different people are motivated by different things. For employees motivated by a need for achievement, a leader explains how the task offers an opportunity to take on a challenge with an achievable goal. And employees are motivated by hearing how they will be part of a team of people working together.\nGood leaders will introduce employees by name first, rather than job titles. They refer to employees as team members, companions, or colleagues, never as \"servants\". Words have power, including the power to make people feel whether or not they are important to the success of an organization.\nGood leaders believe that every team member matters and set up environments that make everyone feel important. It is no wonder they can attract the support they need to help them achieve their goals.", "label": "A"}

This wouldn't have been possible if there were no wireless Internet for laptops. Wireless Internet has come into our life in so many ways that we don't even realize what a necessary part it has become of our day-to-day lives.\nHow do we connect to a wireless Internet service for laptop computers? There are two ways to do this. They are Wi-Fi connection and Bluetooth connection. Wireless networking is very easy. You just switch on the Wi-Fi button that has been provided in the laptop for Wi-Fi scanning. Once that is done, the computer will connect to the Internet.\nAn interesting fact about Wi-Fi networking is that you can create a network between similar wireless equipment. Consider a situation where you and your friend both have Wi-Fi laptops, and there is some data you want to exchange. Traditional networking architecture demands that you have a wireless router  . But the beauty of Wi-Fi networking technology is that you can set up a network between you and your friend's laptop, and share all the data you want.\nBroadband   Internet connection is typically preferred by any user as it provides better speed for Internet surfing. Up until the invention of 3G mobile phones, Internet speed on mobile phones was very slow. 3G has the promise of changing the entire face of broadband technology. Just imagine browsing at speeds of more that 2MB per second. To give you a measure of the speed, 3G enables you to watch high quality live videos on the Internet.\nIt is amazing to see how technology changes and the rate at which it changes.

So, he had to get a job.\nDuring his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm.

When people hoard a massive amount of objects, it takes over the inhabitable spaces of their home. As the collection grows, they are unable to do simple , _ activities such as cooking a meal or watch TV. Sometimes the hoarding is so severe that parts of their homes become inaccessible.\nBut among the many problems that such behavior brings about, the most significant are the health risks. Once hallways and windows are blocked, hoarders are at the risk of dying in a fire, since they no longer have a clear path of evacuation . Things that are piled up high can fall on top of the homeowner, or a person trying to climb over a pile of objects can experience a fall. There is also the problem of sanitation . Areas where food can't be properly cleaned begin to attract insects, and bathrooms that are full of many possessions can no longer be washed.\nUnfortunately, the serious effect of the problem can become worse for two reasons. One is that since the behavior progress behind closed doors, people can accumulate collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem. A second reason is that hoarders often don't recognize that they have a problem, and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help.\nWhen attempting to make a diagnosis, psychologists don't regard hoarding as a disorder in itself. Instead, it's often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder  , depression, or anxiety.

It is the main language accepted and spoken in the fields of business and education across all places in India. India is ranked the third largest English-speaking population in the world besides the US and the UK.\nEnglish writing has blossomed   in India and has reached a peak where Indian writers like Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth and Salman Rushdie were able to distinguish themselves in the whole world. Many Indian authors bring out books on Indian culture and literature.

This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance.\nThe English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. \"Armchair\",for example,suggests comfort,whereas \"chair\" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways.\nBoth the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language.\nThe language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others.

Finally his creation led to what we know is called flippers!\nSo you don't have to be adult to be an inventor. One thing you do need, though, is something that kids have plenty of: curiosity and imagination. Kids are known for looking at things in new and unique ways.\nSo what should you do if you have what is a great idea for an invention? Talk to a friend or family member about it. Get input from others about your idea. Then ask them to help you create a working model--called a prototype of your idea.\nOnce you have a prototype, you can test it.

When I noticed that he hadn't got the tools for a proper cleanup, I offered him mine, which he gratefully accepted. After this, it seemed only natural to engage him in conversation.

I made her that cross and the copper letters.\"\nThen he went on:\"No one comes to visit this grave but me because I was her only child. She died of pneumonia. My father remarried and my stepmother only cared for her own children. So then I always came here to my mother, whether in sadness or in joy.

How much easier is my lot, I thought, for at any moment I can reach into my storehouse of memories and draw out the joyful or sad vignettes  that bind me to my parents with a thousand threads. What memories might this kindly old gentleman harbor? Perhaps a face from an ancient faded photograph of his mother.\nWhat a great attachment throughout his long life must have led him back again and again to the resting place of that young woman whose motherly love he could never truly savor , only forever feels its enormous lack.\nWe said good-bye.

Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  . \n     Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\"\n     Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet. \n       Dr Holmes said, \"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\"\n      \"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious. Therefore, many celebrities change their names to ones which reflect these characteristics. This, in turn, influences parents when they choose names for their babies,\" said Dr Holmes, \"however, names connected with ordinary people are seldom chosen for their babies\".", "label": "D"}

In the United States, the change from formal to casual office wear has been gradual. In the early 1990s, many companies allowed their employees to wear casual clothes on Friday, but only on Friday. This became known as \"dress-down Friday\" or \"casual Friday\". \"What started out as an extra one-day-a-week benefit for employees has really become an everyday thing.\" said business consultant Maisly Jones.\nWhy have so many companies started allowing their employees to wear casual clothes? One reason is that it's easier for a company to attract new employees if it has a casual dress code. \"A lot of young people don't want to dress up for work,\" says the owner of a software company, \"so it's hard to hire people if you have a conservative dress code.\" Another reason is that people seem happier and more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes. In a study conducted by Levi Strauss Company, 85 percent of employers said that they believe that casual dress improves employee morale . Only 4 percent of employers said that casual dress has a negative effect on productivity. Supporters of casual office wear also argue that a casual dress code helps them save money. \"Suits are expensive, if you have to wear one every day,\" one person said. \"For the same amount of money, you can buy a lot more casual clothes.\"", "label": "C"}

The river mouth supports shellfisheries and is a nursery ground  for bass   stocks, and the water quality of the Thames has improved.\n    Alastair Driver, the Environment Agency's national conservation manager, said that in the last 150 years, the Thames had been polluted seriously and that it had taken thousands of people decades to restore it to its current condition. \"Strict regulations for polluting industries and our work with farmers, businesses and water companies to reduce pollution and improve water quality have helped to make the Thames a living river once again.\" But he warned that the river's recovery was still \" _ \", since it was under the pressure from a growing population and climate change. He said advanced projects and cooperation with various people and organizations aim at dealing with the problems the Thames faces and ensuring  it still a famous river for  many centuries to come.\n    Actor, David Suchet, a skillful boater and chairman of the River Thames Alliance, said, \"I am fortunate in my life to have traveled widely and enjoyed many other rivers worldwide. But the River Thames is priceless and it is one of the most glittering jewels in the crown of our English heritage.\"\n    Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, said, \"The Thames is one of our most precious resources, so I am excited to see that efforts to improve and preserve its good health are being praised on the world stage.\"\n    The PS 220,000 prize, awarded at the International Rive Symposium in Australia, will go to the Thames Rivers Restoration Trust.", "label": "A"}

Once inside, he read her mail and helped her pay her bills.\nMailboxes were sometimes used for things other than mail. One note left in a mailbox read. \"Nat, take these eggs to Marian; she's baking a cake and doesn't have any eggs. \" Mailboxes might be buried in the snow, or broken, or lying on the groom:. bat the mail was always delivered On cold days Dad might find one of his customers waiting for him with a cup of hot chocolate. A young wrote letters but had no stamps, so she left a few button on the envelope in the mailbox; Dad paid for the stamps. One businessman used to leave large amounts of cash in his mailbox for Dad to take to the bank. Once, the amount came to 8 32,000.\nA dozen years ago, when I traveled back to my hometown on the sad occasion of Dad's death,  the mailboxes along the way reminded me of some of his stories. I thought I knew them all, but that wasn't the case.\nAs I drove home, I noticed two lamp poles, one on each side of the street. When my dad was around, those poles supported wooden boxes about four feet off the ground. One box was painted green and the other was red, and each had a long narrow hole at the top with white lettering: SANTA CLAUS, NORTH POLE. For years children had dropped letters to Santa through those holes.\nI made a turn at the comer and drove past the post office and across the railroad tracks to our house. Mom and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I heard footsteps. There, at the door, stood Frank Townsend, Dad's postmaster and great friend for many years. So we all sat down at the table and began to tell stories.\nAt one point Frank looked at me with tears in his eyes. \" What are we going to do about the letters this Christmas?\" he asked.\n\"The letters?\"\n'I guess you never knew. \"\n\"Knew what?\"\n\" Remember, when you were a kid and you used to put your letters to Santa in those green and red boxes on Main Street? It was your dad who answered all those letters every year. \"\nI just sat there with tears in my eyes. It wasn't hard for me to imagine Dad sitting at the old table in our basement reading those letters and answering each one. I have since spoken with several of the people who received Christmas letters during their childhood, and they told me how amazed they were that Santa had known so much about their homes and families.\nFor me, just knowing that story about my father was the gift of a lifetime.", "label": "D"}

Americans of all professions know how to do business \nD. even arts and entertainment are regarded as business", "context": "Henry Ford, the famous U.S. inventor and car manufacturer, once said, \"The business of America is business.\" By this he meant that the U.S. way of life is based on the values of the business world.\nFew would argue with Ford's statement. A brief glimpse at a daily newspaper vividly shows how much people in the United States think about business. For example, nearly every newspaper has a business section, in which the deals and projects, finances and management, stock prices and labor problems of corporations are reported daily. In addition, business news can appear in every other section. Most national news has an important financial aspect to it. Welfare, foreign aid, the federal budget, and the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank are all heavily affected by business. Moreover, business news appears in some of the unlikeliest places. The world of arts and entertainment is often referred to as\"the entertainment industry\"or\"show business.\"\nThe positive side of Henry Ford's statement can be seen in the prosperity that business has brought to U.S. life. One of the most important reasons so many people from all over the world come to live in the United States is the dream of a better job. Jobs are produced in abundance because the U.S. economic system is driven by competition. People believe that this system creates more wealth, more jobs, and a materially better way of life.\nThe negative side of Henry Ford's statement, however, can be seen when the word business is taken to mean big business. And the term big business--referring to the biggest companies, is seen in opposition to labor. Throughout U.S. history working people have had to fight hard for higher wages, better working conditions, and the fight to form unions. Today, many of the old labor disputes are over, but there is still some employee anxiety.

Loring's lab at TSRI is working together with scientist Oliver Ryder of the San Diego Zoo to use pluripotent stem cells to try to increase the number of the northern white rhino.

A woman can often say that men and women should take equal responsibility  for housework.\nVery few men are raised to be fully responsible for housework, and many men look on housework as women's work. On the other hand, most men will readily work around the yard, make repairs and complete projects on weekends or evenings, and it's important that you give your man appreciation for those things, too. Most men will take on a little additional housework around the house if asked politely. They are even more likely to do housework if they can choose what they want to do, and do it without being monitored.\nHere's the key: men want to feel that they are doing housework either because they want to do a task, or because they simply want to please their women.

In child raising, the carrot should never be materialistic things. If you want to ask for good behavior with a reward, it should be with something that can't be bought, say, trust. The stick Nowadays, no one likes to use the stick any more, or in my father's case, the belt. I'm not overlooking child abuse, if you ever want to call it that, but I am encouraging parents to toughen up a bit. You don't want your kid to test your limits only to find out he can get away with it. If you want to raise a kid, raise the hand and let him know it comes down on the second offense.\nAt the office\nThe carrot\nPeople need encouragement and motivation to perform well. However, the carrot only really works well with employees who have already proved themselves. Ifyou've got someone who can't show up at the office before noon, the promise of a raise isn't going to do much. On the contrary, if there's a guy with a good work moral, he'll thrive (grow stronger) when you add a promotion to the picture.\nThe stick\nWhen considering the carrot or the stick in the office, remember that, overall, the stick is the more practical method in the office. A wise man, who just happened to be an Italian, once said \"It's best to be both loved and feared.\" It's nice to have everyone love you, but running a business isn't like running a family. You need to have the stick constantly raised.\nWith the wife\nThe carrot\nWhen it comes to marriage, always use the carrot. I've had a lovely marriage for many years, and I've always stuck to the carrot approach.\nSometimes you catch more flies with honey, and sometimes it's the crack of a whip  that gets the horse moving.

But in the past several years, there are more difficulties in teaching, for many, than there are rewards.\nUnruly students, especially in big cities, large classes and a lack of support from the public in terms of money and understanding have led many public school teachers to leave the profession.\nAs a result, many of the best students, who would have chosen teaching as their life career in the past, are going into other fields.\nAnother reason for this change in teacher candidates is the changing status of women in the United States. Until the late 1960s and 1970s, one of the most popular choices for women was teaching. But as other professions, such as law and medicine opened up to women, women stopped pouring into teacher training programs.

Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.\n    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.\nWhile the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.\nWorld food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.\nAs a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.\nRegional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living.

This, when one comes to think of it, is a tremendous feat, though, curiously enough,  ly little attention has been devoted to the fundamental problems of how and why we acquire this gift for recognizing and remembering faces. Is it an inborn property of our brains, or an acquired one? As so often happens, the experts tend to differ.\nThus, some argue that it is inborn, and that there are \"special characteristics about the brain's ability to distinguish faces\". In support of this, they note how much better we are at recognizing a face after a single encounter than we are, for example, in recognizing an individual horse. On the other hand, there are those, and they are probably in the majority, who claim that the gift is an acquired one.\nThe arguments in favor of this latter view, it must be confessed, are impressive. It is a habit that is acquired soon after birth. Watch, for instance, how a quite young baby recognizes his mother by sight. Granted that his other senses help - the sound, his sense of smell, the distinctive way she handles him. But of all these, sight is predominant. Formed at the very beginning of life, the ability to recognize faces quickly becomes an established habit, and one that is, essential for daily living, if not necessarily for survival. How essential and valuable it is we probably do not appreciate until we encounter people who have been deprived of the faculty.\nThis unfortunate inability to recognize familiar faces is known to all, but such people can often recognize individuals by their voices, their walking manners or their spectacles. With typical human ingenuity, many of these unfortunate people overcome their handicap by recognizing other characteristic features.", "label": "D"}

And for those who were both obese and currently smoking, risk of circulatory disease increased 6 to 11 times under the age of 65, as compared to their never-smoking, normal weight counterparts.\nWhile it's not surprising that obesity coupled with smoking is a recipe for trouble, it is important to highlight this growing health concern in America today.\nTaking Charge of Your Health\nMaking healthy choices can be difficult when we're constantly bombarded with products that are hazardous to our health, but it's not impossible.

Britain used to be called \"empire on which the sun never sets\",which gained its supreme  power mostly by its naval( )military forces. The period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars was a time of fierce naval competition between England and the Netherlands. At that time, the British used \"Dutch\" as a word for something bad, or false, or mistaken.\nA \"Dutch agreement\" was one made between men who had drunk too much alcohol. \"Dutch courage\" was the false courage produced by the effects of drinking alcohol. And \"Dutch leave\" was what a solider took when he left his base without permission.\nSome of these old expressions are still used today with a little different meaning. \"Dutch treat\" is one example. Long ago, a Dutch treat was a dinner at which the invited guests were expected to pay for their own share of the food and drink. Now, Dutch treat means that when friends go out to have fun, each person pays his own share.\nAnother common expression heard a few years ago was \"in Dutch\", which simply referred to the country then. Nowadays, if someone says to you, you are in Dutch, they are telling you that you were in trouble. An important person, a parent or teacher perhaps, is angry with you.\nSome of the Dutch expressions heard in American English have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all. In the 1700s, Germans who moved to the United States often were called Dutch. This happened because of mistakes in understanding and saying the word \"Deutsch\", the German word for German. Families of these German people still live in the eastern United States, many in the state of Pennsylvania. They are known as the Pennsylvania Dutch.\nDuring the American Civil War, supporters of the northern side in the central state of Missouri were called Dutch, because many of them were German settlers. In California, during the Gold Rush, the term Dutch was used to describe Germans, Swedes, and Norwegians as well as people from the Netherlands.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt once noted that anything foreign and non-English was called Dutch.One expression still in use, \"to talk to someone like a Dutch uncle\", did come from the Dutch.The Dutch were known for the firm way they raise their children. So if someone speaks to you like a Dutch uncle, he is speaking in a very severe way. And you should listen to him carefully.", "label": "C"}

So the idea that in 20 years' time, no one will own cars may be hard to believe. But this is the prediction made by a team of transport researchers who are taken seriously, not only by government but also by car manufacturers.\nThe Human Science and Advanced Technology Institute at Loughborough in the UK is part of an international research program. The team there believes that by 2020 all cars will be computerized. That will mean much saving, no accidents and better use of roads. The super-intelligent car in the future will drive itself.  And it will not be owned by one individual. Instead, we will have a choice of cars and change them as frequently as we change our clothing.\nAccording to Dr. David Davis, who leads the research team, these predictions are based on the rising cost of the car culture, which had blocked up our cities, polluted our air, and caused more deaths than both world wars put together.\nDavis says, cars will be fitted with some intelligent devices  to regulate  the distance between one car and another. The car will automatically speed up, or slow down, to match the speed of the car in front. computers are much safer drivers than people, so cars in a road train will be able to drive much closer together than cars driven by people.\nBy 2016, Dr. David Davis believes, car technology will give motorists a clear view of the road, whatever the weather conditions, by projecting an image of the road ahead on to the car's windscreen. And by 2020, cars will travel in line, linked to each other electronically. Cars will be connected by an electronic tow bar to the car in front to form \"road-trains\". \"The front vehicle in such a train burns the normal amount.\"says Davis. \"but all the others in the train would burn about ten percent of the normal amount,  and so produce about ten percent of the pollution.\"", "label": "C"}

Researchers have long known that people with dyslexia write or read words and letters backwards in the wrong order.\nBut a new study shows that people with dyslexia may have trouble redirecting  their attention between senses, from seeing something to hearing something. The study suggests something that might help dyslexic people learn more quickly - play video games.\nVanessa Harrar of Britain's University of Oxford led the study. She reported the findings in the journal Current Biology. The study suggests that dyslexic people may have trouble moving quickly from what they read to what they hear. Doctor Harrar calls this a \" _ shifting of attention across the senses.\"\n\"So, if you are trying to read something and then trying to listen to somebody who's reading aloud and you're trying to follow along with what they are reading -- they have to switch their attention from hearing what they are saying to looking at the piece of paper and back again. So we found they have quite sluggish shifting of attention across the senses,\" said Harrar.\nIn the study, Doctor Harrar tested 17 people with dyslexia, and 19 others without reading problems. The volunteers were asked to push a button as quickly as possible when they heard a sound, saw a light or experienced both together. Doctor Harrar compared the speed of their reactions.\nShe found that people with dyslexia were just as fast as the others when they saw only a picture or heard only a sound. But the dyslexics had a slower reaction time when they heard a sound and saw a picture at the same time.\nDoctor Harrar feels like playing action video games could help dyslexic people shift from seeing to hearing more quickly. She adds that images in video games force the eyes to move and focus quickly.\n\"Video game types of things pop out of here and there, they move your eyes around the screen quite quickly in response to things quite quickly, and the more you play a video game the faster you get that kind of thing. So, the video game is really training the attention system to move quickly,\" said Harrar.\nThe study also shows that dyslexic people have the most difficulty going between what they saw and what they heard, this may have an effect on how dyslexic children are taught how to read.\nWhen children learn the alphabet,they usually see the letter first and then hear the sound, or they see and hear the letter at the same time. The study shows that dyslexics might learn more quickly if they hear the sound of a letter or word first before seeing it.", "label": "D"}

These five colors symbolize the five elements that form the world; earth, water, fire, wind and sky. Another explanations that red is the sun, green is the grassland, yellow is the earth, blue is the sky, and white is the cloud.\nThe wind-horse flag originated with a monk who obtained a scripture from India. When he crossed a river, he carelessly dropped the scripture into the water. He quickly saved the scripture and spread it out on a big rock to dry as he sat in meditation .

Their early songs were influenced by American rock and roll musicians, including Chuck Berry. But the Beatles looked different and sounded different from any musical group before them.\nThe Beatles released their first album in the United States in 1964, when all of the top five records in America were by the Beatles. In 1967, they released an album called \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" It was one of the first \"concept\" albums. That is, all the songs were linked by a common story or idea.\nThe popularity of the Beatles led the way for more rock and roll bands from England to become popular in America. The Rolling Stones was the most important of these bands. The Rolling Stones is one of the few groups from the 1960's that is still performing and recording today. In 1965, the group recorded one of its most famous songs, \"Satisfaction\".\nThe musical instrument most linked to rock and roll is the guitar.

Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant.\nTwenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21.\nReformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \"responsible attitudes\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink.\nThough new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \"obviously drunk\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy.\nAs the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \"noble experiment\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution.", "label": "C"}

This was the first real task I received in my new school. It seemed simple: go on the Internet and find information about a man named George Washington. Since my idea of history came from an ancient teacher in my home country, I had never heard of that name before. As I searched the name of this fellow, it became evident that there were two people bearing the same name who looked completely different! One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts, while the other led some sort of army across America. I stared at the screen, wondering which one my teacher meant. I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: flip   a coin. Heads--the commander, and tails--the peanuts guy. Ah! Tails,my report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver.\nWeeks later, standing before this unfriendly class, I was totally lost. Oh well, I lowered the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear,\"My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American Revolution.\" The whole world became quiet! How could I know that she meant that George Washington?\nObviously, my grade was awful. Heartbroken but fearless, I decided to turn this around. I talked to Miss Lancelot, but she insisted: No redos; no new grade. I felt that the punishment was not fair, and I believed I deserved a second chance. Consequently, I threw myself heartily into my work for the rest of the school year. Ten months later, that chance unfolded as I found myself sitting in the headmaster's office with my grandfather, now having an entirely different conversation. I smiled and flashed back to the embarrassing moment at the beginning of the year as the headmaster informed me of my opinion to skip the sixth grade. Justice is sweet!", "label": "A"}

When Harry married in 1894, he and his wife Bess worked together as magician and assistant. But for a long time they were not very successful. Then Harry performed his first prison escape in Chicago in 1898. Harry persuaded a detective to let him try to escape from the prison, and he invited the local newspapermen to watch.\nIt was the publicity   that came from this that started Harry Houdini's success. Harry had fingers trained to escape from handcuffs and toes trained to escape from ankle chains. But his biggest secret was how he unlocked the prison doors. Every time he went into the prison cell, Bess gave him a kiss for good luck and a small skeleton key, which is a key that fits many locks.

This kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype.\nSoon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travelers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains.\nIn about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of films and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.\nMathew Brady was a famous American photographer.

So when the hand was extended to someone, it showed that the person was not armed or ready for fight.\nWe know that the hand was an important symbol in early religion, probably as a mark of power. The Greeks prayed to their gods with raised hands. Presenting the hands palm to palm was at one time the way an inferior  person paid respect to a superior  one.\nAmong the Arabs, it was customary at one time to kiss the hand of a superior.

So people using biomimicry try to use examples in nature to design new technology.\nBiomimicry is not a new idea. People have been studying nature for hundreds of years. Leonardo DaVinci used birds as models to invent his flying machine. And when the Wright Brothers made the first successful airplane, they also studied birds. In 998, Janine Benyus, a natural science writer and teacher, wrote a book about biomimicry.

Scientists want to copy these same ways to make light shine off computers. They hope this will make for more colorful screens.\nAnother example of biomimicry is the bullet train. It travels at speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour! But it had a problem: it made too much noise!\nThrough the observation of birds, scientists thought about a kind of bird, the kingfisher .

You can watch a movie while you pedal by floating a microcomputer anywhere you want. But station residents have to be careful about staying in one place too long. Without gravity to help circulate air, the carbon dioxide you exhale   has a tendency to form an invisible  cloud around you head.

But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.\nAt very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs.

This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer.

Most of them are resting in the shade under brushes, but there was one that was drinking from the watering hole directly in front of us. We then noticed just to our right, there were a couple of fresh zebra corpses -- it seemed as if the lions which were resting had killed them! We were unlucky not to have seen the actual kill, as our guide had mentioned that the zebra corpses were fresh and the kill had occurred within the last hour.\nOur final big sighting was one that none of us were expecting to see, even our guide! We pulled over to where there was a large gathering of cars, with a sleeping leopard there! We took photos happily and excitedly and observed its surprising body before returning to our hotel as it was getting late.\nSo, I hope you enjoyed my description of Tarangire, and that I have inspired you to add this amazing park to your very own Tanzania travel route.", "label": "D"}

A good place to stay can often make a holiday. Whether you are looking for a classy hotel or a night under the stars, we can guide you through your different options.\nBed and Breakfast\nAn English invention, bed and breakfasts offer exactly what they suggest, a bed for the night and breakfast in the morning. People who hate the anonymity of hotels but want more luxury than a hostel often choose to stay at bed and breakfasts. \"B&B's\", usually someone's private home, are often found in the countryside.\nHostels\nFor those traveling on a tight budget, hostels are the best accommodation option. Informal places usually with a friendly youthful vibe , they offer dormitory beds for rent. Bathrooms are usually down the hall.\nRemember to check reviews by previous guests online before you book your hostel.\nCouch Surfing\nAn unusual but interesting option, couch surfing is a growing trend among young internationals. The idea is that you become a member of the online couch-surfing community (www. couchsurfing. com) and then when you travel, look up other members in that country and ask to stay on their couch  . Most hosts will suggest sightseeing trips and take you out in the evening, making it a great way to see things that aren't in your guidebook. And remember, it may be free but don't forget to offer to buy your host a drink or dinner.\nCamping\nSleeping under the stars! For budget travelers staying at camping grounds is the cheapest way to travel. The drawback is that you have to carry a tent with you. Camping grounds can be found across Europe, America and Australia. However, if you intend on camping in busy cities, check first where the nearest campsite is. More often than not, they are on the outskirts, which can mean lengthy bus rides into town when you want to eat or see the sights.", "label": "C"}

A good one can fetch as much as PS 52,000 in the Tokyo fish markets. \"In my lifetime, we've brought this big fish to the doorstep of death in the western Atlantic Ocean,\" said Barbara Block of Stanford University in California. \"The electronic way of tracks provides the best scientific information we've ever had to manage these tuna and we must, as an international community, start to act actively to make sure of the future of this fish. \"\nScientists have repeatedly said that the harvest of the seas cannot be as good as before. There are fewer and fewer fish in around Newfoundland, North Sea and Iceland, so fishermen have pushed further offshore in search of deep ocean fish. Tuna--in the Mediterranean and Japan--have been under increasing pressure for years. The International Commission on the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna has tried to manage the fish since 1969.There are two populations: a western one that has dropped by 80% in the past 30 years, and a larger, eastern population. Although catches are controlled by 3,000 tons a year in the western fishery, and 32,000 in the east, no one knew whether the limits worked.\nSo Professor Block and her team placed tracks on hundreds of the fish and tracked them to depths of more than 900 metres and on journeys of thousands of miles, measuring the movement, body and water temperatures. \"There are two ways to save the Atlantic bluefin tuna--protect them in their production grounds and in their feeding grounds,\" Prof. Block said. \"This will need immediate action in both the central Atlantic, to reduce the loss of the big fish while hunting, and in the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean, where tuna produce as separate populations. \"", "label": "D"}

In 1974, 25-year-old Nyad became the first person to swim across Lake Ontario against the current. A year later, Nyad's 28-mile swim around the island of Manhattan made the front page of the New York Times. \n\"Physically, I'm stronger. I weigh a lot more,\" Nyad said after a training swim in Key West in June. \"There are also mental advantages to being older,\" says Steven Munatones, an expert in swimming. \nFeeling a sharp pain in her right shoulder, she changed the angle of stroke  , telling herself to go gently until her hand caught the water. In the 17thhour, she swam over to the boat, and the crew located a pain reliever. Nyad took it.

But I was shaking and freezing, and I thought, 'There's no mind over matter anymore.' I think I'm going to have to go to my grave without swimming from Cuba to Florida.\" \nBut when Nyad returned home to Los Angeles, the pain began to fade. \"Something says to me the goal is still there,\" says Nyad.", "label": "D"}

Now, the only hunting they know is to catch seals from floating ice in the open ocean. In March, polar bear mothers and babies have to swim from the land in Spitsbergen to the edge of the polar ice cap.\nNormally this is a short swim, since in March the polar ice cap is very close to the land, and the polar bears, and even the babies, are good swimmers. However, last year we saw that the polar ice cap had become smaller in size due to global warming. \nSwimming hundreds of miles, especially when they are hungry and have babies following them, is really hard, and many bears are dying because of starvation.\nThe polar bear population in the Spitsbergen area was once threatened by hunters. In the 1970s, a ban on hunting was imposed  and the polar bear population has been steadily increasing from just a few hundred to about 2,000 to 3,000. This was a great success story. However, now, because of global warming, the population is again in danger. If we do not stop making so much carbon dioxide, we will lose these beautiful animals forever.\n   The polar bears are just one example of animals that have become endangered because of man's appetite for energy obtained by burning fossil fuels. All life on earth could be in danger unless we change our ways. What can we do? To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air we must save and make energy without burning coal and oil.

We chatted about tea and Chinese cooking and how much my boys have grown since we arrived. One man said, \"They were pocket-sized when you came here. Now they're taller than you. How time flies.\"\nHow life flies. And Chinese are smart enough to share what they know they cannot keep. They freely give of their time, never too busy to help a friend. And they are teaching me, slowly, to both give and receive. So the next time someone says, \"No charge. We're friends.\" I will thank them heartily. But if they show up later asking me to tutor them in English, I'll make sure they tutor my son in Chinese as well, because there's still no free lunch.", "label": "A"}

He was determined to get good grades -- in part to make sure his white roommate had no basis for negative racial views. \"You're pushed to do better, to challenge the stereotype that black people are not that smart,\" he told theNew York Times.\nSeveral recent studies have found that having a roommate of a different race can reduce prejudice , diversify  friendships and even promote students' academic performance. In a study by Ohio State psychology professor Russell Fazio, black freshmen who came to college with high test scores earned better grades if they had a white roommate--even if the roommate's test scores were low. Another study on student interaction by Duke University suggests that freshmen with roommates of a different race were the most likely to diversify their friendships. \"Just having diversity in classrooms doesn't do anything to increase interracial friendships,\" said Claudia Buchman, an author of the Duke study. \"But living together with a different-race roommate does lead to more interracial friendships.\"\nThere are, however, some problems with such room assignments. Fazio's study found that three times as many randomly  assigned interracial roommates weren't living together at the end of the semester, compared with white roommates. Interracial roommates also spent less time together, had fewer joint activities and were less involved with each other's friends than white pairs.\nAs for Boakye, this is not the case. \"A lot of white students come without much exposure to diversity, so when their first interaction with a black guy isn't bad, they will make more black friends.

They remembered what conditions caused changes and observed the factors associated with weather: atmospheric and cloud conditions, temperature, winds, and reactions of plants and animals. Many people believe that this way of forecasting weather is accurate more often than modem forecasting.\nGrandma's aching joints might indicate the arrival of a low-pressure system. She might also observe the geese flying lower than usual, confirming the low-pressure system. Finally, she might feel dampness on her skin, a sign of high humidity  . Based on these three observations, grandma might warn that a storm is brewing.\nJoints and nerves can indicate dropping air pressure, dissolved gases in the blood form bubbles under low air pressure. This causes pain in joints and nerve endings. Geese and other birds respond to changes in air pressure by adjusting how high they fly. In the fair, calm weather of a high-pressure system, the birds fly higher than in the stormy weather associated with a low-pressure system.\nNature provides other clues to changing weather. A decrease in air pressure causes deer and elk to come down from the mountains to look for shelter. Some animals feed more than usual. The higher humidity before a storm causes some insects to leave the trees and gather near the ground. Some flowers close so rain doesn't get inside them. In winter, rhododendron plants curl up to protect themselves as the temperature drops.\nSeveral of the sayings apply in particular areas of the world. Here are some of them.\n#Early thunder, early spring.\n#Rainbow in the morning gives you fair warning.\n#When teeth and bones ache, expect the clouds to fill the lake.\n#When high clouds and low clouds do not match together, prepare for a blow and a change in the weather.", "label": "C"}

Bird's creative, trial-and-error type of learning provides an ideal model for studying similar processes in humans. An example is how a baby's babble turns into the recognizable syllables of mama and papa.\nAlso the part of the brain that is involved in bird song is very similar to that of a human. So birds may have something to teach us about our own brains, Fee said.\nThe study shows that young birds like to create new and imperfect songs. Gradually, the youngsters' songs become less different and more similar to the sound of their parents. Scientists disabled part of a young finch's brain and stopped the learning in midstream. The bird still sings. But never learns the right songs.\nFee's team found that the part of the brain involved is called the anterior forebrain pathway. Its neurons produce random bursts that make the young bird make new sounds and compared it with that of their parents.

It is a manufacturing   philosophy developed in the 1920's and 1930's, when mass production became popular. The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. This pressures the consumer to buy again.\nPlanned obsolescence does keep costs down. Instead of making an expensive product that will last a long time, businesses produce more affordable, disposable  items. Some electronic items have become so inexpensive that it is cheaper to replace them than to repair them.[:&&Z&X&X&K]\nBusy people often value their time and convenience more than money. If a car starts to have mechanical problems, replacing it with a newer, more reliable model may be more appealing than tolerating it being in the garage for a week.\nIn addition, advertising trains consumers to want what is new and improved. It convinces them that the more they have, the happier they will be.\nUnlike people in many developing countries, we live in a world of abundance.

Native Americans also discovered ways to use herbs and other plants as medicines.\nNative American inventions, such as canoes, ponchos and parkas ,hammocks and snowshoes are still in use today. Other marks of Indian culture were left in American place names. The state of Alaska, for example, takes its name from a Native American word meaning \"great land\".\nToday nearly 1.5 million Native Americans live in the United States. Some still preserve the ways of their ancestors, speaking Indian languages and keeping alive their legends, art forms, and customs. Other Native Americans keep few of the old ways, but remain proud of their people's contributions to American history.\nAmericans have come to appreciate the beauty of Indian crafts . Many artists find  _ in traditional Indian designs. Many Indian values, too, have become widely held.

Children with cri du chat usually have problems understanding ideas and might have a hard time learning to talk. Many also have weak muscles that can cause problems with walking or using their fingers to pick things up. The term cri du chat means \"cry of the cat\" in French. Babies with cri du chat often have a high-pitched cry that sounds like that of a little cat.\nOver the years, Derek's teachers helped him learn sign language and gestures.

Raeann wanted to donate money to Derek's school. \"I just wanted to help my brother,\" she says, \"and the people who help him.\"\nAt first, Raeann focused on creating jewelry that would raise awareness for cri du chat.

To create those symbols, Raeann researched the color most often associated with raising awareness for the disease or disorder, such as pink for breast cancer or orange for leukemia.\nIn the end, it turned out to be a great idea.

But our research shows that eating lots of fruit and vegetables is actually more effective.\"\nThe team first assessed the skin color of people in relation to their diet. Those who ate more fruit and vegetables a day were found to have a more golden, yellow skin color. Those with a healthy glow had a higher presence of carotenoids , which play a role in the immune system. Carotenoids are commonly found in fruit and vegetables such an yellow and red peppers, spinach, apricots and melons.\nThe team then studied the relation between skin tone and attractiveness. They used specialist software to operate the skin color on the images of 51 faces to simulate more or less carotenoids and suntans. Participants were then asked to adjust the skin color to make the faces look as healthy as possible. Given the choice between skin color enhanced by suntans and skin color enhanced by carotenoids, people preferred the carotenoids skin color.\nThe study shows that not only do people use skin color to judge how healthy other individuals are, but they are accurate when they make those judgments.

Couple of years ago, this seems an impossible task for scientist to accomplish. All this progress in science leads us to believe that the day, when the human being will be cloned, is not far away. Human cloning has always been a topic of argument,in terms of morality or religion.\nTaking a look at why cloning might be beneficial, among many cases, it is arguable that parents who are known to be at risk of passing a genetic limitation to a child could make use of cloning. If the clone was free of genetic limitations. Then the other clone would be as well. The latter could foe inserted in the woman and allowed to ripen to term. Moreover,cloning would enable women, who can't get pregnant, to have children of their own.\nCloning humans would also mean that organs could be cloned, so it would be a source of perfect transfer organs. This, surely would be greatly beneficial to millions of unfortunate people around the world that are expected to lose their lives due to failure of single(or more) organ(s).It is also arguable that a ban on cloning may be unlawful and would rob people of the right to reproduce and limit the freedom of scientists.\nArguments against cloning are also on a perfectly practical side. Primarily, I believe that cloning would step in the normal \"cycle\"of life. There would be a large number of same genes., which reduce the chances of improvement,and, in turn, development-the fundamental reason how living things naturally adapt to the ever-changing environment. Life processes failing to do so might result in untimely disappearance. Furthermore, cloning would make the uniqueness that each one of us possesses disappea. Thus, leading to creation of genetically engineered groups of people for specific purposes and, chances are, that those individuals would be regarded as \"objects\" rather than people in the society.\nScientists haven't 100 percent. guaranteed that the first cloned will be normal. Thus this could result in introduction of additional limitations in the human \"gene-pool\".\nRegarding such arguable topics in \"black or white\" approach seems very innocent to me personally. We should rather try to look at all \"shades: of it. I believe that cloning is only legal if its purpose is for cloning organs, not humans.

They find that if a dog wags its tail to the left. it's feeling anxious or nervous. The reason could be an unfamiliar or dangerous situation,an unfamiliar person,or an unfamiliar and possibly threatening dog. But if the tail is wagging to the right,it means the dog is feeling relaxed and approachable.\n\"The tail is a very important signal,\"said Thomas Reimchen,a biologist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. \"There is a lot of visual information that dogs use when communicating with each other. \"\nHow did the scientists figure all this information out? They had the dogs in their study watch videotapes of other dogs. When the dog on the tape wagged its tail to the right,they say the other dogs remained calm and cool. But when the dog on the tape wagged its tail to the left,the other dogs got anxious.\nThe researchers are still not exactly sure if the direction of tail wagging is something the dog does consciously.

Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English.\nEnglish has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction  such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation.\nBy the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich.

Test-takers who receive lower scores than they have hoped for are likely to be concerned about their academic future. It's no wonder that it's hard to discuss the test without negative feelings.\nThe SAT isn't perfect. Like any test, it can be misused, and may reflect unequal educational opportunities. Even before the announcement of the SAT's redesign, experts were discussing the test's limitations. Writing in The New Yorker, Elizabeth Kolbert described its questions as limited: \"Critical thinking was never called for, let alone curiosity or imagination.\" But the SAT provides an effective measure of a person's ability to reason through verbal  and mathematical materials, a skill required in college. Although there are conflicting reports on the issue, a study published in the journal Educational and Psychological Measurement in 2011 found that the SAT can meaningfully add to the prediction of a student's first-year college academic performance, above his grades in high school alone. The fact that the SAT can help predict this is, to me, an astonishing achievement that cannot be ignored.\nWe cannot afford to ignore tests because they fall short of perfection or make us uncomfortable. But there's a better way to make the SAT more acceptable in the long run: We should expand the types of tests we use so as to more fully reflect what students can do. What if, in addition to the SAT, students were offered new tests that measured more diverse abilities? For future artists or musicians, there are tests that measure creative thinking --a largely ignored ability by the SAT. For future engineers, there are tests that measure their sense of space.

Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small.\nThe problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls.\nIf it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art.\nMany ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams.\nIt hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface   private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals   for property owners, and get paid for them.\nMaybe we need to start at a very basic level, and find a way to encourage the creation of graffiti art on paper or canvas rather than on walls.

It is claimed that living on an island separated from the rest of Europe has much to do with it. Whatever the reasons are, it may be fairly stated that the Englishman has developed many attitudes and habits which distinguish him from other nationalities.\nBroadly speaking, the Englishman is a quiet, shy, reserved person who is fully relaxed only among people he knows well. In the presence of strangers or foreigners he often seems _ , even embarrassed. You have only to witness a city train any morning or evening to see the truth of this. Serious-looking businessmen and women sit reading their newspapers or having a light sleep in a corner, and no one speaks. In fact, to do so would seem most unusual. An Englishman, pretending to be giving advice to overseas visitors, once suggested, \"On entering a railway carriage, shake hands with all the passengers.\" Needless to say, he was not being serious. There is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior which, if broken, makes the person immediately suspected.\nIn many parts of the world it is quite normal to show openly extremes of enthusiasm, emotion, excitement, etc, often accompanied by appropriate gesture. The Englishman is somewhat different. Of course, an Englishman feels no less deeply than anyone of a different nationality, but he tends to display his feelings far less. This is reflected in his use of language. Imagine a man commenting on the great beauty of a young girl. A more emotional man might describe her state \"Oh, she is a goddess\", whereas an Englishman might just say \"Oh, she's all right.\" An Englishman who has seen a highly successful and enjoyable film recommends it to a friend by commenting, \"It's not bad you know\", or on seeing some very unusual scenery he might convey   his pleasure by saying, \"Nice, yes, very nice.\" The overseas visitor must not be disappointed by this apparent lack of interest and involvement. Instead, he must realize that \"all right,\" \"not bad,\" and \"nice,\" very often have the sense of \"first-class,\" \"excellent,\" \"beautiful\".

If prying into  other's lives were an Olympic sport, then Team GB would surely take the gold medal.\nAnd when the British can't watch the lives of real people, they have another source of entertainment to fall back on--the soap opera. British soap operas are very different to US TV dramas. For one, they are normally longer running. The two most popular, Coronation Street and East-enders, have been running for 48 and 24 years respectively. Both are broadcast several times a week, so remarkably there have been more than 7,000 _ of Coronation Street.\nThe most obvious difference is that, unlike US dramas, the British soap operas focus on the real world. There is little glamour  , the stars are rarely rich, and they normally have boring jobs. Perhaps the appeal is that the lives of the characters often mirror the lives of the audience--but with some drama added. This means the viewer can relate to the characters and feel the pain and happiness they go through on the show.\nBecause these soap operas last for decades, the cast is ever changing. The shows rarely focus on one or two main characters. Like the real world, people come and go all the time. However, there are exceptions. Coronation Street's William Roach, 76, has played the role of Ken Barlow since the very first episode of the show in 1960, and he is still a regular.\nThe choice of which soap opera you follow is often cultural: People from the north of British tend to watch Coronation Street as it is set in Manchester. People from the south generally prefer East-enders, which is set in the east of London. The show is generally considered grittier and is aimed at a younger audience.", "label": "B"}

His face was white, but very homely. When Aesop was about twenty nine years old ,his master lost a great deal of money and was determined to sell his slaves. To do this, he had to take them to a large city where there was a slave market.\nThe city was far away, and the slaves must walk the whole distance. A number of bundles  were made up for them to carry. Some of these bundles contained the things they would need on the road. \"Choose your bundles, boys,\" said the master. \"There is one for each of you.\" Aesop at once chose the largest one. The other slaves laughed and said he was foolish. But he threw it upon his shoulders and seemed well satisfied. The next day, the laugh was the other way. For the bundle which he had chosen had contained the food for the whole party.\n\"Aesop is a wise fellow,\" said his master. \"The man who buys him must pay a high price.\" A very rich man, whose name was Xanthus, wanted a servant. As the slaves stood before him he asked each one to tell what kind of work he could do. All were eager to be bought by Xanthus because they knew he would be a kind master. So each one boosted of his skill in doing some sort of labor. One was a fine gardener; another could take care of horses; a third was a good cook; a fourth could manage a household. \"And what can you do, Aesop?\" asked   Xanthus. \"Nothing,\" he answered. \"Nothing? How is that?\" \"Because, since these other slaves do everything, there is nothing left for me to perform,\" said Aesop.\nThis answer pleased the rich man so well that he bought Aesop at once, and took him to his home on the island of Samos.

They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results.\nGrades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities.\nThe Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am).\nThe project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are \"out of sync \" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning.\n\"We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,\" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. \"Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings.\"\nEveryone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females.\n\"Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,\" said Epsie.\nThe results could be positive, based on previous studies.\nAn early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent.\nThe Oxford project is expecting to publish the results in 2018.

Nearly a decade ago it was predicted that viewers of \"Friends\", a popular situation comedy, would soon be able to purchase a sweater like Jennifer Aniston's with a few taps on their remote control. \"it's been the year of interactive television advertising for the last ten or twelve years,\" says Collin Dixon of a digital-media consultancy.\nSo the news that Cablevision, an American cable company, was rolling out interactive advertisements to all its customers on October 6th was greeted with some skepticism. During commercials, an overlay will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting viewers to press a button to request a free sample or order a catalogue. Cablevision hopes to allow customers to buy things with their remote controls early next year.\nTelevision advertising could do with a boost. Spending fell by 10% in the first half of the year. The popularization of digital video recorders has caused advertisers to worry that their commercials will be skipped. Some are turning to the Internet, which is cheaper and offers concrete measurements like click-through rates-especially important at a time when marketing budgets are tight. With the launch of interactive advertising, \"many of the dollars that went to the Internet will come back to the TV,\" says David Kline of Cablevision. Or so the industry hopes.\nIn theory, interactive advertising can engage viewers in a way that 30-second spot or not. Unilever recently ran an interactive campaign for its Axe deodorant , which kept viewers engaged for more than three minutes on average.\nThe amount spent on interactive advertising on television is still small. Magna, an advertising agency, reckons it will be worth about $138 million this year. That falls far short of the billions of dollars people once expected it to generate. But DirecTV, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have all invested in it. \nYet there are doubts whether people watching television, a \"lean back\" medium, crave interaction. Click-through rates have been high so far (around3-4%, compared with less than 0.3% online), but that may be a result of the novelty.

It fell onto Venus.", "context": "Scientists know of more than 1,000 volcanoes on the surface of Venus, Earth's \"sister\" planet. A big question has been: Are they still active? The scientists say yes.\nTheir evidence for recent volcanic activity on Venus comes from a lava  flow in the planet's northern hemisphere. The flow is hotter than the rocks around, which means the lava might still be cooling off. \"The flow we studied seems to be very young---it is still warm inside,\" Nataliya Bondarenko said.\nVenus is a difficult planet to study from Earth because it is surrounded by thick clouds. Telescopes on Earth can't see through these clouds, so the best information about Venus comes from spacecraft orbiting it.\nBondarenko and her colleagues studied the lava flow using data from NASA's Magellan mission. That spacecraft spent four years in orbit around Venus and used radar to make a map of 98 percent of the planet's surface. On October 11th, 1994, the mission ended, and the spacecraft plunged   through Venus' heavy cloud cover and crashed onto the planet below.\nWhile in orbit, the Magellan craft sent microwaves, which can go through Venus' clouds, to the surface. Microwaves are invisible and can be as long as three feet. These waves are a kind of energy, like light. And like light, they bounce off surfaces. The way the waves bounced off the Venus' surface and back to the craft supplied information that the scientists used to estimate the temperature of various parts of the planet's surface. Bondarenko's team found that the lava flow was hotter than its surroundings---which may mean the lava flow is in the process of cooling.\nThe scientists say the lava flow can't be very old because if it were, it would have cooled off enough that Magellan wouldn't have noticed the difference in microwaves. She adds that the flow appears in a 1978 view of the surface that a craft called the Pioneer Venus Orbiter captured.", "label": "D"}

A new study indicates that dog ownership specifically may be one of the biggest single contributors to what kinds of microbes live on your skin.\nA team of researchers led by Se Jin Song at the University of Colorado, Boulder, took swabs  of the tongues, palms, forehead and feces  of members of 60 family households. Some of the families had children or household pets and some did not; dogs were the only pets swabbed.\nResearchers then analyzed the DNA of the bacteria they found to determine how diverse the bacteria populations were. Not surprisingly, family members who lived together had more bacteria in common than members of separate households. Bacteria on the skin were especially similar within households, probably because we pass microbes through the air, through direct contact, and via the surfaces we touch.\nThe most surprising finding, however, was the large bacteria contribution Fidonad made. The skin bacteria of dog owners from different households was almost as similar as if they'd cohabited without a dog. Put another way, you and a friend across town who both own dogs share a skin ecosystem as alike as a married couple does.\nThe reason for this appears to be that dogs harbor some kinds of bacteria that are rare on human skin. One in particular, a family of bacteria called Methylophilaceae, was abundant in the mouths of dogs sampled as well as the skin of their owners--indicating \"a common occurrence of oral-skin transfer between dogs and their owners,\" according to the results published in the journal eLife.", "label": "B"}

Sewing machines, washing machines and tumble dries are common enough today, but a hundred years ago few people could even imagine such things. However, inventors have designed and built a wide range of household machines since then. In most cases the inventor tried to patent his machine, to stop anyone copying it. Then he tried to produce a lot of them. If the machine became popular, the inventor could make a lot of money. \nIn 1790 the first sewing machine was patented. The inventor was an Englishman called Thomas Saint. There was nothing to match his machine for forty years, and then someone built a similar device. He was a Frenchman, Bartelemy Thimonier. Neither of these early machines worked very well, however. It wasn't until 1846 that an inventor came up with a really efficient sewing machine. He was an American, Elias Howe and his machine was good enough to beat five skilled sewing women. He didn't make much money from it, however. The first commercially successful sewing machine was patented by Isaac Singer five years later. \nToday, we take washing machines for granted, but there was none before 1869. The revolving drum of that first machine set a pattern for the future, but it was crude by today's standards. The drum was turned by hand, and needed a lot of effort. Eight years passed before someone produced an electric washing machine. The world had to wait even longer for a machine to dry clothes. The first spin-drier was another American invention, patented in 1924; but it was 20 years before such machines were widely used. \nIt was yet another American, called Bissell, who introduced the carpet sweeper. He patented the original machine back in 1876. It didn't pick up dirt very well, but it was quicker than a dustpan and brush.

Three basic ways may be described as the market system, the administered system, and the traditional system.\nIn a market system individual economic units are free to interact among each other in the marketplace. It is possible to buy commodities from other economic units or sell commodities to them. In a market, transactions may take place via barter or money exchange. In a barter economy, _ goods such as automobiles, shoes, and pizzas are traded against each other. Obviously, finding somebody who wants to trade my old car in exchange for a sailboat may not always be an easy task. Hence, the introduction of money as a medium of exchange eases transactions considerably. In the modern market economy, goods and services are bought or sold for money.\nAn alternative to the market system is administrative control by some agency over all transactions. This agency will issue commands as to how much of each good and service should be produced, exchanged, and consumed by each economic unit. Central planning may be one way of administering such an economy. The central plan, drawn up by the government, shows the amounts of each commodity produced by the various firms and allocated to different households for consumption. This is an example of complete planning of production, consumption, and exchange for the whole economy.\nIn a traditional society, production and consumption patterns are governed by tradition; every person's place within the economic system is fixed by parentage, religion, and custom. Transactions take place on the basis of tradition, too. People belonging to a certain group or caste  may have an obligation to care for other persons, provide them with food and shelter, care for their health, and provide for their education. Clearly, in a system where every decision is made on the basis of tradition alone, progress may be difficult to achieve. An inactive society may result.", "label": "B"}

The yield didn't match the effort: I don't think she collected more than $10. Still, she sent the collection to the organization.\nEven as a child, I knew my mother's actions were great, which aroused my pride in her. Asking poor people to give to an organization which aimed to help others wasn't what you did. Other charities gave to these folks; you didn't ask them to give. To them , her efforts likely seemed foolish. But to me, her efforts had an influence on me as I grew up.\nAlthough my charitable giving is modest, I faithfully and regularly donate to the organization which is aimed at fighting AIDS; to stop hunger, and homelessness; to support public broadcasting, the arts, and public education; and to heal families. And I volunteer my time to teach little girls and fix our badly broken public schools.\nI do these things because I believe I've been given much, so much is required of me. I never asked my mother why she collected those donations, and, besides, the lung cancer that killed her twenty-one years ago prevents me from asking now.\nBut had I asked, my mother's response would have been simple:\"Because I can.\"That's what she would have said.

Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf.\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods.\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English.\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut.

These crystals grow from water particles in cold clouds. They usually grow around a piece of dust. All snow crystals have six sides, but they grow in different shapes. The shape depends mainly on the temperature and water levels in the air. The shape of a snow crystal may change from one form to another as the crystal passes through levels of air with different temperatures. Snow contains much less water than rain. About seventy-five centimeters of snow has as much water as two and one-half centimeters of rain.\nGenerally, the color1 of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected ( ). Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white color1.\nMuch of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow gives water to rivers and crops. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold. Fresh snow is made largely of air which is kept among the snow crystals.

Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:\n\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy.

There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing\nfar better than Russia.\nBut the BRICs are not just about economy.

They believe perching on one of the topmost branches of the academic tree will also improve the quality of their work, by bringing them together with other geniuses with whom they can collaborate and who may help spark new ideas. This sounds reasonable. Unfortunately,as Albert Laszlo Barabasi of Northeastern University,in Boston (and also, it must be said, of Harvard), shows in a study published in Scientific Reports, it is not true.\nDr Barabasi and his team examined the careers of physicists who began publishing between 1950 and 1980 and continued to do so for at least 20 years. They ranked the impact of the institutions these people attended by counting the number of citations each institution's papers received within five years of publication. By tracking the association of individual physicists and counting their citations in a similar way, Dr Barabasi was able to work out whether moving from a low to a high-ranking university improved a physicist's impact. In total, he and his team analysed 2,725 careers.\nThey found that, though an average physicist moved once or twice during his career, moving from a low-rank university to an elite one did not increase his scientific impact. Going in the opposite direction, however, did have a small negative influence. The consequence is that elite university do not,at least as far as physicists are concerned,add value to output.

Of course we were worried; we had just moved from Berlin, and she was just 8. But when she came home, we realized we had no reason to panic. Beaming with pride, she told us how she had discovered the little park around the corner, and had made friends with a few local dog owners.\nWhen this story comes up in conversations with American friends, we usually meet with polite disbelief. Most are horrified by the idea that their children might roam  around without adult supervision.\nA study by the University of California has found that American kids spend 90 per cent of their leisure time at home, often in front of the TV or playing video games. Such narrowing of children's world has happened across the developed world. But German parents are generally much more accepting of letting children take some risks.\n\"We are depriving  them of opportunities to learn how to take control of their own lives,\" writes Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College. He argues that this increases the chance that they will suffer from anxiety, depression, and various other mental disorders, which have gone up dramatically in recent decades.\nI am no psychologist like Professor Gray, but I know I won't be around forever to protect my girls from the challenges life holds in store for them.

It actually ended up being a fun and adventurous experience.\nThe ride there was definitely long but worth it. As I woke up from my nap, I saw the beautiful scenery of the tall mountains and beautiful streams. The trails were made nicely for visitors. The waterfalls were breathtaking. Climbing up rocks was one of my favorite parts. Even though I fell a couple of times, I still have a lot of fun. The fact that my family and I spent so much time together all trying to find out which route to take and what views to watch really brought us closer together.\nThe great thing about nature is that, it's just you, the views, and the people around you. There's nothing there to bother you and it's the best way to relax and enjoy yourself. Yosemite has 5 of the world's highest waterfalls, and about 300 lakes. The structure of each mountain is incredible; it's formed in ways that almost take your breath away. Some of them are of a deep dark color1 with waterfalls forming; some are formed with spots of green peeking   out. It's definitely something you wouldn't want to miss. \nYosemite isn't the only great National Park but based on my experience I highly recommend going out and enjoying nature with family and friends.

In the last ten years, five of the six novels have been made into Hollywood films, while her books continue to be bestsellers. So why is Austen still popular?\nRichard Jenkyns, a professor of English at Oxford University, argues that her novels still appeal to people because they focus on issues that are as _ today as they were when she wrote them. Her novels are about women trying to find a perfect husband, but also explore issues surrounding marriage, friendship and the family. \"The plots are fairly timeless stories about human interaction which are familiar to us,\" Jenkyns says.\nThe most famous book Austen wrote is Pride and Prejudice,a love story betweenElizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. At first the two characters do not get on. They finally fall in love, but still have to overcome opposition   to their relationship from their families.\nAll of Austen's books are easy to read, making them popular with children and adults, but they work on different levels so people can take what they need from them, author Kate Henry says.\nAusten is often praised as the greatest romance writer in the English language, so it is surprising she remained unmarried. \"Maybe she was too much of a romantic, waiting for a perfect man,\" Henry says.", "label": "A"}

After each bath, she sang, \"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers.\nNow Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did.

Boys typically like to play with cars and trucks, while girls typically choose to play with dolls. Why is this? A traditional sociological explanation is that boys and girls are socialized and encouraged to play with different types of toys by their parents, peers, and the \"society\". Growing scientific evidence suggests, however, that boys' and girls' toy preferences may have a biological origin.\nIn 2002, Gerianne M. Alexander of Texas A&M University and Melissa Hines of City University in London surprised the scientific world by showing that monkeys showed the same sex typical toy preferences as humans. In the study, Alexander and Hines gave two masculine toys (a ball and a police car), two feminine toys (a soft doll and a cooking pot), and two neutral toys (a picture book and a stuffed dog) to 44 male and 44 female monkeys. They then assessed the monkeys' preference for each toy by measuring how much time they spent with each. Their data showed that male monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the masculine toys, and the female monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the feminine toys. The two sexes did not differ in their preference for the neutral toys.\nIf children' s toy preferences were largely formed by gender socialization, as traditional sociologists' claim, in which their parents give \"gender appropriate\" toys to boys and girls, how can these male and female monkeys have the same preferences as boys and girls?They were never socialized by humans, and they had never seen these toys before in their lives.", "label": "C"}

The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the happening of the slave trade. Ships from Europe travelled to the West African coast, where they exchanged cheap goods for black slaves. The slaves were shipped in terrible conditions to the Caribbean islands and the American coast, where they were in turn exchanged for such products as sugar and molasses . The ships then returned to England, completing an \"Atlantic triangle\"of journeys, and the process began again. Britain and the United States had outlawed the slave trade by 1865, but by that time, nearly 200 years of trading had taken place. By the middle of the nineteenth century, there were over four million black slaves in America.\nThe policy of the slave-traders was to bring people of different language backgrounds together in the ships, to make it difficult for groups to plan rebellion. The result was the growth of several pidgin   forms of communication, and in particular a pidgin between the slaves and the sailors many of whom spoken English. Once arriving in the Caribbean, this pidgin English continued to act as a major means of communication between teh black population and the new landowners, and among the blacks themselves. Then, when children came to be born, the pidgin became their mother tongue, thus producing the first black Creole  speech in the region.

Sharing the joy of gardening with children.", "context": "Gardening can be a very relaxing hobby for many people and this wonderful experience is not just for adults. Children are interested in gardening as well, if given the chance to explore nature and science in this way. Gardening can bring joy to both children and their parents alike, especially when the experience is shared together.\nThe time that is spent gardening together builds precious memories within their hearts and minds for years to come. When you are gardening with your children, try to give them their own special area. Keep their area in the center of the best soil and light, as you want to make sure of a successful gardening experience.\nPlastic tools easily break and are difficult to use in the dirt, so when you are gardening with your children, give them real tools to use if possible. Even offering to let them use your tools is a way to admit the worth of the work they are doing. It is also important to talk with your children about the whole process of gardening, from planting to the harvest. They need to understand how things work and the importance of what they are doing.\nShow off the children's gardening work by taking friends and visitors for a walking tour through the garden and point out the children's particular spot. When you give attention to the children's work, this is a great motivation  for children to continue wanting to be involved. Do not force children to take part when they are in a bad mood or if they are becoming bored. Instead, allow them to do something different, like building a scarecrow ! This makes the gardening experience even more interesting. As you work together side by side with your children, you will encourage a love of the land in them, as well as create lasting memories of time spent with you.", "label": "D"}

As polar expert Walt\nMeier puts it, \" _ \nSome scientists worry that Arctic sea ice may be going from a downward spiral   to a \"death spiral\", one from which there is no escape. As more ice melts  , more dark open water appears. The darkness absorbs   more heat, which speeds up the pace of melting.\nUntil recently, many scientists thought it might take until the end of the century for the North Pole to become completely ice free during the summer. Now some believe it could happen by 2030 or even earlier. \"The melting is happening faster in the real world than it has in the models,\" says Nick Toberg.", "label": "B"}

The findings, based on performances and self-evaluation by about 275 college students, indicate that many people multitask not out of a desire to increase productivity, but because they are easily distracted   and can't focus on one activity. And \"those people turn out to be the worst at handling different things,\" said David Sanbonmatsu, a psychologist at the University of Utah.\nSanbonmatsu and his colleagues gave the students a set of tests and asked them to report how often they multitasked, how good they thought they were at it, and how sensation-seeking   or imperative   they were. They then evaluated the participants' multitasking ability with a tricky mental task that required the students to do simple mathematical calculations while remembering a set of letters.\nNot surprisingly, the scientists said, most people thought they were better than average at multitasking, and those who thought they were better at it were more likely to report using a cellphone while driving or viewing multiple kinds of media at once. But those who frequently deal with many things at the same time were found to perform the worst at the actual multitasking test. They also were more likely to admit to sensation-seeking and impulsive behavior, which connects with how easily people get bored and distracted.\n\"People multitask not because it's going to lead to greater productivity, but because they're distractible, and they get sucked into things that are not as important.\" Sanbonmatsu said.\nAdam Gazzaley, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not a member of the research group, said one limitation of the study was that it couldn't find out whether people who start out less focused   toward multitasking or whether people's recognizing and understanding abilities change as a result of multitasking.\nThe findings do suggest, however, why the sensation-seeker who multitask the most may enjoy risky distracted driving. \"People who are multitasking are generally less sensitive to risky situations.\" said Paul Atchley, another researcher not in the group. \"This may partly explain why people go in for these situations even though they're dangerous.\"", "label": "C"}

The federal government has a graduated income tax, that is, the percentage of the tax (14 to 70 percent) increases as a person's income increases. With the high cost of taxes people are not very happy on April 15, when the federal taxes are due.\nThe second tax is for the state government: New York, California, North Dakota, or any of the other forty-seven states. Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government. Of course, the percentage for the state tax is lower. Other states have a sales tax, which is a percentage charged to any item  which you buy in that state. For example, a person might want to buy a packet of cigarettes for twenty-five cents. If there is a sales tax of eight percent in that state, then the cost of the cigarettes is twenty-seven cents. This figure includes the sales tax. Some states use income tax in addition to sales tax to raise their revenues  . The state tax laws are various and confusing.\nThe third tax is for the city. This tax comes in two forms: property tax (people who own a home have to pay taxes on it) and excise   tax, which is charged on cars in a city. The cities use these funds for education, police and fire departments, public works and municipal   buildings.\nSince Americans pay such high taxes, they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes. People always complain about taxes. They often protest that the government uses their tax dollars in the wrong way. They say that it spends too much on useless and impractical programs. Although Americans have different views on many issues, they tend to agree on one subject: taxes are too high.", "label": "A"}

In them there were no dreams of Mediterranean voyages or blue Southern skies. Three months on the Island was what his soul desired. Three months of assured board and bed and good company, safe from north winds seemed to Soapy the most desirable thing.\nJust as the more fortunate New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach each winter, Soapy had made his arrangements for his annual journey to the Island. And now the time had come.\nThere were many institutions of charity in New York where he might receive lodging and food, but to Soapy's proud spirit the gifts of charity were undesirable. You must pay in humiliation of spirit for everything received at the hands of mercy. So it was better to be a guest of the law.\nSoapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire. He left his bench and went up Broadway. He stopped at the door of a glittering cafe. He was shaven and his coat was decent. If he could reach a table in the restaurant, the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's mind. A roasted duck, with a bottle of wine, a cigar and a cup of coffee would be enough. Such a dinner would make him happy, for the journey to his winter refuge.\nBut as Soapy entered the restaurant door, the head waiter's eye fell upon his shabby trousers and old shoes. Strong hands pushed him in silence and haste out into the street.\nSome other way of entering the desirable refuge must be found.\nAt a corner of Sixth Avenue Soapy took a stone and sent it through the glass of a glittering shop window. People came running around the corner, a policeman at the head of them. Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of the policeman.\n\"Where is the man that has done that?\" asked the policeman.\n\"Don't you think that I have had something to do with it?\" said Soapy, friendly.\nThe policeman paid no attention to Soapy. Men who break windows don't remain to speak with policemen. They run away. He saw a man running and rushed after him, stick in hand. Soapy, disgusted, walked along, twice unsuccessful.\nOn the opposite side of the street was a restaurant for people with large appetites and modest purses. Soapy entered this place without difficulty. He sat at a table and ate beefsteak and pie. And then he told the waiter he had no money.\n\"Go and call a cop,\" said Soapy. \"And don't keep a gentleman waiting.\"\n\"No cop for you,\" said the waiter. \"Hey!\"\nThen Soapy found himself lying upon his left ear on the pavement. He arose with difficulty, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed a rosy dream. The Island seemed far away.\nAfter another unsuccessful attempt to be arrested for harassing a young woman, Soapy went further toward the district of theatres.\nWhen he saw a policeman standing in front of a glittering theatre, he thought of \"disorderly conduct\". On the sidewalk Soapy began to sing drunken songs at the top of his voice. He danced, cried, and otherwise disturbed the peace.\nThe policeman turned his back to Soapy, and said to a citizen, \"It is one of the Yale boys celebrating their football victory. Noisy, but no harm.\"\nSadly, Soapy stopped his useless singing and dancing. The Island seemed unattainable. He buttoned his thin coat against the north wind.\nIn a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man who had set his silk umbrella by the door. Soapy entered the store, took the umbrella, and went out with it slowly. The man with the cigar followed hastily.\n\"My umbrella,\" he said.\n\"Oh, is it?\" said Soapy. \"Well, why don't you call a policeman? I took your umbrella! Why don't you call a cop? There stands one on the corner.\"\nThe umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise. The policeman looked at them curiously.\n\"Of course,\" said the umbrella man, \"well, you know how these mistakes occur...if it's your umbrella I hope you'll excuse me - I picked it up this morning in a restaurant - if it's yours, I hope you'll...\"\n\"Of course it's mine,\" said Soapy.\nThe ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to help a well-dressed woman across the street.\nSoapy threw the umbrella angrily. He was angry with the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. They seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong.\nAt last Soapy stopped before an old church on a quiet corner. Through one window a soft light glowed, where, the organist played a Sunday anthem. For there came to Soapy's ears sweet music that caught and held him at the iron fence.\nThe moon was shining; cars and pedestrians were few; birds twittered sleepily under the roof. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends.\nThe influence of the music and the old church produced a sudden and wonderful change in Soapy's soul. He thought of his degraded days, dead hopes and wrecked faculties.\nAnd also in a moment a strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of this pit; he would make a man of himself again. Those sweet notes had set up a revolution in him. Tomorrow he would be somebody in the world. He would...\nSoapy felt a hand on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Then come along,\" said the policeman.\n\"Three months on the Island,\" said the Judge the next morning.", "label": "C"}

Many teenagers smoke, drink and even fight. They often do something dangerous.\nEarlier studies have shown that teenagers are more likely   to make _ decisions than people from any other age group, including children and adults. Is it that teenagers are too young to tell right from wrong? Not really. So what's the reason?\nAccording to Laurence, a teacher from a US university, the reason is that teenagers care a lot about how their peers   view them--that is \"peer influence\".\nAs children enter their teenage years, they spend more time with their friends and classmates, and also they care more about what they think of them. This makes teenagers make decisions without thinking about the costs.\nIn a test, a group of teenagers were asked to play a video driving game. When they played with their friends watching around them, they took more chances and drove more carelessly because that would increase their possibility of winning. But when they played alone, they drove more safely.\nWhy do peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior?\nAs Laurence sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator   but a weak brake  . The \"accelerator\" is fully developed by teenage years while the \"brake\" is still not fully developed. When teenagers are watched by their peers, they usually push hard on the accelerator. With their weak brake, it is likely that they are going to end up in an accident.\nBut the good news is that a violent  teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. \"They get more self-controlled.\"", "label": "D"}

Tips on making your garden bright.", "context": "In late summer or early fall the large, yellow seed heads of sunflowers will be ripening. If gardeners can keep off the birds and other wildlife trying to eat the seeds, they can have a large harvest. The bright yellow blooms will make a rainbow garden, brightening up any space.\nHowever, planting the sunflower seeds is a skilled job. Plant seeds no deeper than the full length of itself. Smaller sized sunflowers can be spaced a foot apart. Larger varieties will need to be spaced as far apart as three feet. This allows ripe plants enough space for the seed heads to ripen without knocking the ripe seeds off before gardeners have a chance to harvest them.\nMost sunflower seeds, especially those with eatable seeds, are large enough to handle without the need for seed sorters. This is why sunflowers make an excellent choice for a children's garden as well. Gardeners will want to mix plenty of soil fertilizers into the ground as sunflowers tend to be heavy feeders.\nSunflowers can be slow starters and the tiny new plants don't seem to grow very rapidly. Gardeners should protect the new plants as they begin to grow. Once they get going, sunflowers are able to _ many weeds, making them easier to grow in the home vegetable garden than many other plants.\nMost pests and diseases are not a bother to the sunflower, however, more than one gardener has said that their lovely looking plants were destroyed overnight by hungry squirrels, mice or birds. To preserve their harvest, gardeners can cover the ripening seed head with stockings or net cloth to help keep the destroyers off the seeds.\nPlanting sunflower seeds is easy and can help even the smallest gardener feel successful in their gardening attempts.", "label": "A"}

She was their neighbor. Yet none of the 32 helped her. Not one even called the police. Was this in gunman cruelty? Was it lack of feeling about one's fellow man?\nNot so, say scientists John Barley and Bib Fatane. These men went beyond the headlines to probe  the reasons why people didn't act. They found that a person has to go through two steps before he can help. First he has to notice that is an emergency .\nSuppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma   from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk?\nIs the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency.\nSecond, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs.\nThe researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder.\nEight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped.\nIn other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility.\nAre people bothered by situations where people are in trouble? Yes. Scientists found that the people were emotional, they sweated, they had trembling hands. They felt the other person's trouble. But they did not act. They were in a group.

The self-supporting structure would be built around a central post, connecting wind generators and heat pumps on its roof with the basement,where solar,wind,and thermal energy could be stored and turned into electricity.

Several Internet companies have been set up to help small businesses print quality documents from a computer. Earlier this week Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a plan to develop new technologies that will enable people to print even more so they can get a hard copy of a business document, a medical record or just a on-line e-mail, even if they are nowhere near a computer.

What it was to become was a mystery until the dust began to slowly combine into a ball moving around the sun. The problem was that the earth became violent because it was not clear whether the solid shape was to last or not. It exploded loudly with fire and rock, which were in time to produce the water vapor, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen and other gases, which were to make the earth's atmosphere. As the earth cooled down, water began to appear on its surface. Nobody knew that it was going to be different from other planets going round the sun. Water had already disappeared from planets like Mars or satellites like the moon, but it stayed on the earth. This is how the earth began to show its special qualities. Many people think that this was important for the beginning of life. It allowed the earth to dissolve harmful gases, which had become part of the earth's atmosphere, into the oceans and seas. That made it possible for life to begin to develop.\nWhat scientists think is that the earth was different because of the arrival of small plants growing in the water on its surface. Nobody understood that these plants were the start of many changes. They multiplied and filled the first oceans and seas with oxygen .This encouraged the development of early shellfish and all sorts of fish.\nMany millions of years later the first green plants began to appear on land. Scientists believe that taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and filling the air with oxygen helped life to develop. Later land animals appeared. Some were insects. Others, called amphibians, were able to live on land as well as in the sea. When the plants grew into forests, reptiles appeared for the first time. They produced young generally by laying eggs. Later, some huge animals, called dinosaurs, developed, They laid eggs too. They became the most important animals on the earth for millions of years. But when they disappeared, mammals became more important. They were the last group of animals and they were different because they produced their young from within their bodies.\nSmall clever animals, now with hands and feet, appeared and spread all over the earth. They developed new methods of growing food, hunting and moving around. As time went by they covered the earth and have become the most important animals on the planet. But they are not taking care of the earth very well. They are putting too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which prevents heat from escaping from the earth into space.

Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.\n _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster.\nThink of the things you've gained by being patient. When all else fails, I think of the good things that have happened in my life because I waited. Passing up on a few \"so-so\" job offers last year paved the way for me to land a job I really wanted.

You will get used to writing it in English, and you will feel comfortable expressing your ideas in English. Several weeks later, you will see that your writing is improving. In addition, you must speak English every day. You can practice with your classmates outside class. You will make mistakes, but gradually you will become comfortable communicating in English.\nThe third step is to keep a record of your language learning. You can write this in your _ . After each class, think about what you did. Did you answer a question correctly? Did you understand something the teacher explained? Perhaps the lesson was difficult, but you tried to understand it.\nYou must be positive about learning English and believe that you can do it. It is important to practice every day and make a record of your achievements. You will enjoy learning English, and you will feel more confident in yourself.", "label": "B"}

Aside from purchasing holiday gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other occasions throughout the year, including weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can cause _ feelings in gift-givers. Many enjoy the opportunity to buy presents because gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger bonds with one's closest persons. At the same time, many fear the thought of buying gifts; they worry that their purchases will disappoint rather than delight the intended receivers.\nWhat is surprising is that gift-givers have considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift. In the present research, we propose a unique psychological explanation for this overspending problem -- i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they spend with how much receivers will appreciate the gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a gift-recipient's feelings of appreciation). Although a link between gift price and feelings of appreciation might seem intuitive   to gift-givers, such an assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose that gift-receivers will seldom tend to base their feelings of appreciation on the significance weight of a gift than givers assume.\nWhy do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely linked to gift-recipients' feelings of appreciation? Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of thoughtfulness and consideration. According to Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a symbolic ritual , by which gift-givers attempt to signal their positive attitudes toward the intended receiver and their willingness to invest resources in a future relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to send a \"stronger signal\" to their intended receiver. As for gift-receivers, they may not consider smaller and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.\nIn practical terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on gifts, but somehow never learn to measure their gift expenses according to personal insight.", "label": "D"}

Farmers operate strawberry-picking machines.", "context": "Strawberry   fields dotted with hunched-over workers picking and packaging, then pushing the delicate red fruit to waiting trucks -- it is a typical winter scene embedded in the patchwork of homes and farms that make up eastern Hillsborough County.\nThat scene is changing, though, as the labor pool shrinks and technology comes knocking. Wish Farms owner Gary Wishnatzki and his engineer partner Bob Pitzer are banking on technology.\nAs strawberry season wrapped up in February, their driverless strawberry-picking machine drove into the fields for some test runs. The results were impressive and enlightening , Wishnatzki said.\nFor some three years now, farmers have been forced to abandon millions of dollars worth of strawberries in fields, mostly in Hillsborough and Manatee counties, because they lacked laborers, industry experts say. The problem has been just as serious in California, Arizona and other farm communities.\nThe reasons for the shrinking worker pool are numerous. Migrant workers who have picked the fields for years are aging. Young adults in migrant families already in the United States are getting better educations and have more choices these days, including the construction industry, which again is on the upswing. Stricter security is allowing fewer undocumented workers to cross the border from Mexico. And Mexicans are having much smaller families now  -- just over two children per family, compared with 7.3 per family in 1960, according to a Pew Hispanic Center report released in 2012.\nAnd since Mexico's economy bounced back faster than that of the U.S., more Mexicans have been able to find work closer to home, according to the study.\n\"We came up with a concept we perceive as a necessity,\" Wishnatzki said. \"The labor pool has been shrinking for over 10 years now. It has been pretty harmful.\" So in 2012, he and Pitzer formed their partnership, Harvest CROO Robotics, to develop a mechanical picker.\nThe Harvest CROO design has multiple picking heads that will move across a field, picking 25 acres over a three-day period, the typical time for picking fruit as it ripens. It has a \"vision system\" to distinguish between red and green strawberries and is able to get under the leaves to find and pick the ripe berries.\nPicking strawberries is nothing like using a combine on a corn field, coming through and thrashing down the plants. Strawberries are delicate and ripen in various intervals, which Harvest CROO is taking into account in developing its machine.\nA strawberry-picking machine will never completely replace the need for human labor in the fields, Wishnatzki said, but if the machines can supplement labor enough to keep the industry profitable, he and Pitzer will have met their goal.", "label": "B"}

For instance, recent research results indicate that using a bright screen for an hour before bed or even playing violent video games for less than that will not necessarily interfere with teenagers' sleep, he wrote.\nBut longer periods of usage can be harmful to sleep, Mr. Gradisar added. Rather than delaying school start times, he said, the first step should be educating parents about limiting the hours that their children are using technology before bed, and enforcing a consistent bedtime.\nEarly school start times are also commonly blamed for students' sleepiness, especially for adolescents. Secondary schools around the nation and the world have been delaying start times, often with positive results.\nMr. Minnich of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center hesitated to put blame to any particular factor.

Stand Up While You Read This.", "context": "Your chair is your enemy. That is the conclusion of several recent studies. Among people who sit in front of the television for more than three hours each day, those who exercise are as fat as those who don't.\nSo what's wrong with sitting? The answer seems to have two parts. The first is that sitting is one of the most passive things you can do. Compared to sitting, standing in one place is hard work. To stand, you have to tense your leg muscles, and engage the muscles of your back and shoulders; while standing, you often shift from leg to leg. All of this burns energy.\nYou may think you have no choice about how much you sit. But this isn't true. Suppose you sleep for eight hours each day, and exercise for one. That still leaves 15 hours of activities. Even if you exercise, most of the energy you burn will be burnt during these 15 hours, so weight gain is often the cumulative  effect of a series of small decisions: Do you take the stairs or the elevator? Do you walk to the corner store, or drive?\nBut it looks as though there's a more sinister aspect to sitting. Some evidence suggests that when you spend long periods sitting, your body actually does things that are bad for you.\nLipoprotein lipase  is a molecule that plays a central role in how the body processes fats. Low levels of lipoprotein lipase are associated with a variety of health problems. Studies in rats show that leg muscles only produce this molecule when they are actively being moved. The result is that when you sit, an important part of your metabolism  slows down. You may also have a higher risk of suffering from diabetes .\nSome people have advanced radical solutions to the sitting syndrome : replace your sit-down desk with a stand-up desk, or watch television in a rocking chair. But whatever you choose, know this. The data is clear; look out for your chair.", "label": "D"}

Saying thanks is such an easy way to add to the world's happiness.\nSaying thanks not only brightens someone else's world, but it also brightens yours.

Instead of saying thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and every kindness with an equal or superior kindness.

Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club.\nThis resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\"\nMr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University. There was no prize money, but the players delighted in using their wits and their understanding of statistics and probability theory to defeat their clever opponents.\nOf course, Mahjong doesn't have to always be that intense. For young people it can be a way to relax and to socialize, a chance to get away from their computers and talk to other people face to face.

In a group they were very brave. We waited for the police to come until someone said to someone else that the noodles were getting cold, and I said politely, \"Please go and eat. We're O.K.\"\nI was happy to see them go. They had been talking of stricter sentences for criminals, of bringing back the death penalty  and how the President is going to clean up the country. I was thinking, they could be saying all of this over my dead body, and I still feel that stiffer sentences wouldn't change a thing. In a rush all the anger I should have felt for my attackers was directed against these contented people standing in front of their warm, comfortable homes talking about all the guns they were going to buy. What good would guns have been to Jeremy and me?\nPeople all over the neighborhood had called to report our screams, and the police turned out in force twenty minutes later. They were ill-tempered about what was, to them, much trouble about nothing. After all, Jeremy was hardly hurt, and we were hopeless when it came to describing the gunmen. \"Typical,\" said one policeman when we couldn't even agree on how tall the men were. Both of us were able to describe the guns in horrifying detail, but the two policemen who stayed to make the report didn't think that would be much help.\nThe policemen were matter-of-fact about the whole thing. The thin one said, \"That was a stupid thing to do, throwing away the keys. When a man has a gun against your head you do what you're told.\" Jeremy looked properly embarrassed.\nThen the fat policeman came up and the thin one went to look around the outside of the house. \"That was the best thing you could have done, throwing away the keys,\" he said. \"If you had gone into the house with them...\" His voice became weaker. \"They would have hurt her\" --- he twisted his head toward me - \"and killed you both.\" Jeremy looked happier. \"Look,\" said the fat policeman kindly, \"there's no right or wrong in the situation. There's just luck.\"\nAll that sleepless night I replayed the moment those black gloves came up to the car window. How long did the whole thing last? Three minutes, five, eight? No matter how many hours of my life I may spend reliving it, I know there is no way to prepare for the next time --- no intelligent response to a gun. The fat cop was right. There's only luck. The next time I might end up dead.\nAnd I'm sure there will be a next time. It can happen anywhere, anytime, to anyone. Security is an illusion ; there is no safety in locks or in guns.

After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few \"innies\".\nUnlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically  motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard.\nBeing shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they \"own\" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image.\nShyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements. As a result, they are able to acknowledge mistakes, imperfections, knowledge gaps and limitations.\nSince shy people have a lower sensitivity to outside rewards than outgoing ones, they're more comfortable working with little information and sticking to their inner desires. Shy people are also more likely to insist on finding solutions that aren't primarily apparent. Don't believe me? Maybe you'll believe Albert Einstein, who once said, \" _ \" Obviously, finding certainty where uncertainty is typically popular is a huge plus for any successful person.\nThe myth that shy people are less effective leaders than their outgoing fellows is just a misunderstanding.

Like the Sanskrit   drama, Chinese drama avoids tragedy as that term is understood in the West. However, it is frequently filled with a feeling of pity and sympathy, often involving the deaths of women. Chinese drama is more social and less concerned with romantic love than the Sanskrit.

One of the reasons for this judgment is the formlessness of Chinese plays. For example, Hong Sheng's The Palace of Eternal Youth, a play in 49 scenes doesn't have any act divisions. In Chinese drama, no attempt is made at realism. The scenery is symbolic. For instance, a flag represents an army and characters at times directly address the audience. Since the early 19th century, the Beijing opera has been the leading force in the Chinese theatre. After World War I, a realistic, spoken drama, patterned after Western plays, developed.", "label": "D"}

There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time.\nMan has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees.\nWillam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \"great Alachua Savannah.\"\nMost of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here.

Such people often say, \"I'm not any good at writing\" or \"English was not one of my good subjects.\" They imply that they simply do not have a talent for writing while others do. The result of this attitude is that these people try to avoid writing, and when they do write, they don't try their best. Their writing fails chiefly because they believe that they don't have the \"natural talent\" needed to write. Unless their attitude changes, they probably will not learn how to write effectively.\nA realistic attitude about writing must build on the idea that writing is a skill.

The new exam is called the EFSET, which is short for Education First Standardized English Test. The company, Education First, is known by the letters EF.\nIt is estimated that there are two billion English language learners worldwide. Many of them are interested in attending an American college or university. To do so, foreign students need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language -- better known as TOEFL. However, many foreigners are not wealthy enough to take the TOEFL. In addition, test-takers often have to travel overnight to reach an official testing site. The World Bank says an average Cambodian worker earns only about $1,000 per year. Approximately the cost of taking the TOEFL is 17.5 percent of the average worker's yearly wage.\nIt is not just individuals who find the test pricey. Some governments also find it prohibitive. What's more, not everyone needs official results from the TOEFL or IELTS -- the International English Language Testing System. In the future, it's likely that the government may use the EFSET to test millions of employees and students.\nExperts believe that the EFSET meets the highest value in language testing. It uses special computer software that makes the questions easier or harder, depending on one's performance. The EFSET measures all the English learners' levels while the IELTS and TOEFL only measure learners' levels from moderate   to advanced. The EFSET is unique in the sense that it gives free online access to anyone interested in measuring their English level.\nThere is a 50-minute and a two-hour version of the test, which its developers are calling the EFSET Plus. Both versions test only reading and listening skills. It's hopeful that speaking and writing skills will be tested in the future. The IELTS and the TOEFL still use humans to rate the speaking and writing sections. It's a huge deal for students who are in areas where they can't get to the TOEFL or the IELTS.

Wearing the wedding rings on the fourth finger of the left hand is an old custom.\nAfter the ceremony, there is often a party, called a \"reception\" which gives the wedding guests an opportunity to congratulate the new couple.\nThe car in which the couple leaves the church is decorated with balloons. The words \"Just Married\" are painted on the trunk or back window. And then the couple go in their honeymoon.", "label": "B"}

Listen to him, and you will hear the loudness, the quality and musical note of his voice always changing according to what he is talking about.\n      The fact that a good teacher has some of the gifts of a good actor doesn't mean he will indeed be able to act well on the stage, for there are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand. What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words seem natural on the stage.\n      A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience takes an active part in his play--they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand something, they say so. The teacher therefore has to meet the needs of his audience. He can't learn his part by heart, because their brains couldn't keep discipline: they couldn't keep strictly to what another has written.", "label": "D"}

The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing\nfar better than Russia.\nBut the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.\nAt very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.", "label": "A"}

Nowadays, stress is almost a given fact of life. Actually, a certain degree of stress can have positive effects on us. But if stress continues over a long period of time, the effects on the body can be harmful, resulting in health problems and stress-related illness, including heart attack and stroke.\nStress is a normal reaction by the body to what it perceives  as a threatening situation or environment. Short-term reactions may include an increase in heart rate as well as a rise in blood pressure. A person under short-term stress may feel nervous, anxious and even experience shortness of breath. Other reactions can include a dry mouth, quick heartbeat, sweating, stomach upset and diarrhea.\nWhen stress is long-term and becomes more chronic   in nature, it can cause more serious health-related problems, including regular headaches, back pain, weight changes, sleep difficulties, changes in mood and so on. Chronic stress can also result in memory problems, including difficulty remembering new information and the inability to quickly deal with old information.\nNo matter how your body reacts to stress, ignoring the problem can have serious health results. Not surprisingly, more women than men openly seek the help of their family doctors or other health care experts when they are experiencing stress or stress-related illness. Men are more likely to refuse to admit the problem or attempt to self-treat it, which may contribute to higher rate of drug and alcohol addiction seen in men exposed to chronic stress.\nThere's no doubt that stress is a fact of life and is likely to remain a part of our fast-paced society. Although stress can't be completely _ , methods of dealing with stress-related issues, in my view, can be developed so that the effects of stress on the body are avoided, so people won't be so easy to suffer stress-related illness.", "label": "C"}

Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so rapidly that they will not survive for future generations.\nThe mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer, is scattered   with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields   and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti  .\nJean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, \"People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.\"\nHe describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition   of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even cut off parts to take home as souvenirs. \"When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,\" he said. \"The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub them to make them look fresher.\" Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch   their own drawings, or even their names, in the rocks.\nBut experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a \"no-go\" area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced.\nClottes disagrees, \"The measure suggested by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,\" he said. \"The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.\"\nDavid Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. \"Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,\" he said. \"Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is money. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. It doesn't seem to be possible to get the government support.\"\nIn Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach -- tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles -- the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. \"You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,\" she said. \"That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site.

Certainly Newton considered some theoretical aspects of it in his writings, but he was reluctant to go to sea to further his work. \nFor most people the sea was remote, and with the exception of early intercontinental travelers or others who earned a living from the sea, there was little reason to ask many questions about it, let alone to ask what lay beneath the surface. The first time that the question \"What is at the bottom of the oceans?\" had to be answered with any commercial consequence was when the laying of a telegraph cable from Europe to America was proposed. The engineer had to know the depth profile   of the route to estimate the length of cable that had to be manufactured. \nIt was to Maury of the US Navy that the Atlantic Telegraph Company turned, in l853, for information on this matter. In the 1840s, Maury had been responsible for encouraging voyages during which soundings   were taken to investigate the depths of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Later, some of his findings aroused much popular interest in his book The Physical Geography of the Sea. \nThe cable was laid, but not until 1866 was the connection made permanent and reliable. At the early attempts, the cable failed and when it was taken out for repairs it was found to be covered in living growths, a fact which defied contemporary scientific opinion that there was no life in the deeper parts of the sea. \nWithin a few years oceanography was under way.

The toads hop to their breeding ponds after the ground has warmed and the first hard spring rain falls. To get there, many of the toads will cross roads that cut through their habitat. It will be a grand view of hopping toads as well as a disastrous killing by cars!\nThe toads are \"slow in moving at that time of year--it's still cool, they've been inactive--and they get killed\" by cars when crossing roads, said Serrao, a naturalist. An April night five years ago, when Serrao went out to a country road to watch the moving of the toads, he counted 100 toads; 95 were hit by cars. \nA similar story can be told for several other species of toads, frogs, crocodiles and turtles around the world. \nThe world's amphibians are reducing, and road-killing is just one factor behind it. Other better-known causes of the decline include global warming, insecticides , and the loss of wetlands. \nSerrao says unless these animals get help crossing the road, their local populations will disappear. \nJackson, a biologist, said one way to help amphibians survive road crossings is to construct \"amphibian tunnels\" beneath the road. Jackson says tunnels should be a 0.6-meter-by-0.6-meter box, open at the top, and fitted with an iron grate to allow enough air and light into the tunnel. In addition, fences or walls should extend out from either side of a tunnel for about 30 meters, which guide amphibians toward the tunnels. \nEuropean countries have built amphibian tunnels for decades. Jackson led a team that installed the first such tunnel in prefix = st1 /Americain 1987, which helped over 3/4 of the local amphibian population safely cross the road.\nJackson says that there are about a hundred amphibian tunnels in the UStoday, but many of them were not carefully designed and probably not working well because land developers wanted to save money.", "label": "B"}

The melody road uses the spaces between to create different notes.\nDepending on how far apart the grooves are, a car moving over them will produce a series of high or low notes, and designers are able to create a distinct tune.\nPaten documents for the design describe it as notches \"formed in a road surface so as to play a melody without producing simple sound or rhythm and reproduce melody-like tones\".\nThere are three musical strips in central and northern Japan--one of which plays the tune of a Japanese pop song. Reports say the system was invented by Shizuo Shinoda. He scraped some markings into a road with a bulldozer before driving over them and found that they helped to produce all kinds of tones.\nThe _ speed for melody road is 44kph,but people say it is not always easy to get the intended sound.\n\"You need to keep the car windows closed to hear well,\"wrote one Japanese blogger.\"Driving too fast will sound like playing fast forward, while driving around 12mph[20km/h]has a slow-motion effect, making you almost car-sick.\"", "label": "C"}

When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship.\nWhen Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates.

Is Graffiti Art?", "context": "Almost anywhere in the world, you can probably see graffiti  . Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small.\nThe problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls.\nIf it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art.\nMany ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams.\nIt hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface   private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals   for property owners, and get paid for them.\nMaybe we need to start at a very basic level, and find a way to encourage the creation of graffiti art on paper or canvas rather than on walls. After all, who would remember Monet or Picasso if they'd created their masterpieces on walls, only to have them painted over the next day? Finding a solution to such a complex problem is never going to be easy, but with more and more graffiti art being recognized in galleries around the world, we do need to try.", "label": "D"}

Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted.

When he was a boy he ran away from home to work on a ship. However, his father soon found him and brought him home. After that he decided that any future travel he did would be in books.

Milk \nC. contact \nD. trust", "context": "The baby monkey is much more developed at brith than the human baby. Almost from the moment it is born,the baby monkey can move around and hold tightly to its mother. During the first few days of its life the baby will approach and hold onto almost any large,warm, and soft object in its environment , particularly if that object also gives it milk. After a week or so , however, the baby monkey begins to avoid newcomers and focuses its attentions on \"mother\"-----the real mother or the mother-substitute .\nDuring the first two weeks of its life warmth is perhaps the most important psychological thing that a monkey mother has to give to its baby. The Harlows, a couple who are both psychologists, discovered this fact by offering baby monkeys a choice of two types of mother-substitutes ----one covered with cloth and one make of bare wire. IF the two artificial mothers were both the same temperature, the little monkeys always preferred the cloth mother. However, if the wire model was heated, while the cloth model was cool, for the first two weeks after brith the baby monkeys picked the warm wire mother-substitutes as their favorites. Thereafter they switched and spent most of their time on the more comfortable cloth mother.\nWhy is cloth preferable to bare wire? Sometime that the Harlows called contact comfort seems to be the answer, and a most powerful influence it is. Baby monkeys spend much of their time rubbing against their mothers' skins, putting themselves in as close contact with the parent as they can. Whenever the young animal is frightened, disturbed, or annoyed, it typically rushes to its mother and rubs itself against her body. Wire does n't \"rub\"as well as does soft cloth. Prolonged \"contact comfort\" with a cloth mother appears to give the babies confidence and is much more rewarding to them than is either warmth or milk.\nAccording to the Harlows, the basic quality of a baby's love for its mother is trust. If the baby is put into an unfamiliar playroom without its mother, the baby ignores the toys no matter how interesting they might be. It screams in terror and curls up into a furry little ball. If its cloth mother is now introduced into the playroom, the baby rushes to it and holds onto it for dear life. After a few minutes of contact comfort, it obviously begins to feel more secure. It then climbs down from the mother-substitute and begins to explore the toys, but often rushes back for a deep embrace   as if to make sure that its mother is still there and that all is well. Bit by bit its fears of the new environment are gone and it spends more and more time playing with the toys and less and less time holding onto its mother\".", "label": "A"}

It had turned into a desert.", "context": "My family and I lived across the street from Southway Park since I was four years old. Then just last year the city put a chain link fence around the park and started bulldozing the trees and grass to make way for a new apartment complex. When I saw the fence and bulldozers, I asked myself,\"Why don't they just leave it alone?\"\nLooking back, I think what sentenced the park to oblivion was the drought we had about four years ago. Up until then, Southway Park was a nice green park with plenty of trees and a public swimming pool. My friends and I rollerskated on the sidewalks, climbed the trees, and swam in the pool all the years I was growing up. The park was almost like my own yard. Then the summer I was fifteen the drought came and things changed.\nThere had been almost no rain at all that year. The city stopped watering the park grass. Within a few weeks I found myself living across the street from a huge brown desert. Leaves fell off the park trees, and pretty soon the trees started dying, too. Next, the park swimming pool was closed. The city cut down on the work force that kept the park, and pretty soon it just got too ugly and dirty to enjoy anymore.\nAs the drought lasted into the fall, the park got worse every month. The rubbish piled up or blew across the brown grass. Soon the only people in the park were beggars and other people down on their luck. People said drugs were being sold or traded there now. The park had gotten scary, and my mother told us kids not to go there anymore.\nThe drought finally ended and things seemed to get back to normal, that is, everything but the park. It had gotten into such bad shape that the city just let it stay that way. Then about six months ago I heard that the city was going to\"redevelop\"certain wornout areas of the city. It turned out that the city had planned to get rid of the park, sell the land and let someone build rows of apartment buildings on it.\nThe chainlink fencing and the bulldozers did their work. Now we live across the street from six rows of apartment buildings. Each of them is three units high and stretches a block in each direction. The neighborhood has changed without the park. The streets I used to play in are jammed with cars now.

They want you to grow up healthily and happily.\nSo how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Call them if you stay somewhere else later than usual. Say sorry to them when you make mistakes. Take responsibility for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you.\nMost of all, try to think about why your parents do this or do that.

This week the patent on the best-selling drug in history expired--Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol pill which earned Pfizer nearly $11 billion in revenues last year.In all, pill like Lipitor with a combined $170 billion in annual sales will go off-patent by the end of 2015.\nWhat is supposed to happen now is that lots of copycat firms rush in with \"generic\" (ie, chemically identical) versions of Lipitor at perhaps one-fifth of its price.Patients and health-care payers should reap the benefit.Pfizer's revenues should suffer. The same story will be repeated many times, as other best-selling drugs march over the patent cliff\nBut generics makers may face delays getting their cheaper versions to market.Ranbaxy, a Japanese-owned drugmaker, struggled to get regulators' approval for its generic version of Lipitor, and only won it on the day the patent expired.More importantly, research-based drug firms are using a variety of tactics to make the patent cliff slope more gently. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of America's Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is concerned by drugmakers filing additional patents on their products to put off the day when their protection expires.\nAnother tactic  is \"pay-for-delay\", in which a drugmaker facing a legal challenge to its patent pays its would-be competitor to put off introducing its cheaper copy. In the year to October the FTC identified what it believes to be 28 such settlements. American and European regulators are looking into these deals. However, legal challenges against them have been delayed, and a bill to ban them is stuck in Congress.\nTo encourage generics makers to challenge patents on drugs, and introduce cheaper copies,\nan American law passed in 1984 says that the first one to do so will get a 180-day exclusivity period,in which no other generics maker can sell versions of the drug in question, as Ranbaxy supposedly won with Lipitor.\nHowever, Pfizer is exploiting a loophole  in the 1984 law, which lets it appoint a second, authorised copycat--in this case, Watson, another American firm.According to BernsteinResearch, under the deal between the two drugmakers Pfizer will receive about 70% of Watson's revenues from its approved copy of Lipitor.More unusual, Pfizer has cut the price of its original version, and will keep marketing it vigorously. So Ranbaxy faces not one, but two competitors.\nAll this may raise Pfizer's sales by nearly $500m in the last half of 2015 compared with what they would otherwise have been, says Tim Anderson of BernsteinResearch, with revenues then falling after the 180 days are over. Others fear that Pfizer's tactics , if copied, will make the 180-day exclusivity period worth far less, and thus discourage generic firms from challenging patents in the first place.", "label": "A"}

Many shy kids don't do these because they always wonder if they can do very well. In fact, when you take part in activities that interest you, you'll find you can really do very well, and you will meet people with the same interests.\nStart today one small step with one welcoming smile or one volunteer work and show the world inside you, and then you'll become a person who has interests and talents and self confidence.

A study investigated whether taking notes by hand helps you learn better than taking notes on a laptop. It was no contest.\nStudy authors and psychologists Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California- Los Angeles conducted three separate experiments involving a total of 327 students. All students got the same lectures, but some used laptops, and others took notes by hand.\nWhen it came to learning the concepts, the handwriters won. When it came to retrieving facts, the groups were comparable, except when given time to go home and look at their notes, at which point the handwriters did better.\n\"Even when allowed to reviewnotes after a week's delay, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests of both factual content and conceptual understanding,\" the study states.\nLearning suffered not because of \"multitasking\" or the distraction available to students using Wi-Fi- enabled laptops. In the lab, scientists allowed no extraneous activity. Students who paid attention and took deep notes on their laptop still didn't learn as well--in fact, the study suggests the thoroughness of their notes contributes to the problem.\nLaptop users tend to record long, _ quotes, which they type mindlessly. Handwriters are more selective. They \"wrote significantly fewer words than those who typed,\" according to the study. By processing and selecting the more important information, they studied more efficiently, said researchers.\nHere's what's a bit frightening: When the laptop students were instructed to cut down or eliminate the verbatim note taking, they couldn't. The study adds to a ton of evidence that for learning, writing is better and that the hand has a \"unique relationship with the brain when it comes to composing thoughts and ideas.\"\nOf course, the chance of persuading students to put away their laptops is probably zero. Many of them can't write longhand, a forgotten subject in many American schools, itself a source of controversy.\nSo are we stuck with traditional classrooms and learning techniques if we want the brightest pupils? Perhaps not: Another possibility, some have suggested, is apps that permit handwriting on tablets, a compromise that students might accept.", "label": "A"}

Beauty is only skin-deep. One' s physical assets and liabilities don' t count all that much in a managerial career. A woman should always try to look her best.\nOver the last 30 years, social scientists have conducted more than 1,000 studies of how we react to beautiful and not- so-beautiful people. The virtually unanimous conclusion: Looks do matter, more than most of us realize. The data suggest, for example, the physically attractive individuals are more likely to be treated well by their parents, sought out as friends, and pursued romantically. With the possible exception of women seeking managerial jobs they are also more likely to be hired, paid well, and promoted.\nUn-American, you say, unfair and extremely unbelievable? Once again, the scientists have caught us mouthing pieties   while acting just the contrary. Their typical experiment works something like this. They give each member of a group--college students, perhaps, or teachers or corporate personnel managers a piece of paper relating an individual' s accomplishments. Attached to the paper is a photograph. While the papers all say exactly the same thing the pictures are different. Some show a strikingly attractive person, some an average-looking character, and some an unusually unattractive human being. Group members are asked to rate the individual on certain attributes, anything from personal warmth to the likelihood that he or she will be promoted.\nAlmost invariably, the better looking the person in the picture, the higher the person is rated. In the phrase, borrowed from Sappho, that the social scientists use to sum up the common perception, what is beautiful is good.\nIn business, however, good looks cut both ways for women, and deeper than for men. A Utah State University professor, who is an authority on the subject, explains: In terms of their careers, the impact of physical attractiveness on males is only modest. But its potential impact on females can be tremendous, making it easier, for example, for the more attractive to get jobs where they are in the public eye. on another note, though, there is enough literature now for us to conclude that attractive women who aspire   to managerial positions do not get on as well as who may be less attractive.", "label": "D"}
